    previewText: "Induction of <b>Neural Differentiation</b> of Primate ES Cells. PA6 cells were plated on type I collagen- coated chamber slides (Falcon) or gelatin-coated dishes and used as a feeder cell layer (7, 15).  To strictly avoid contamination by incidentally <b>differentiating cells</b>, we manually selected undifferentiated ES cell colonies with stem cell-like morphology (tightly packed cells with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio; see Fig. 1A). Undifferentiated ES cell colonies were first washed twice with GMEM medium supplemented with 10% knockout serum replacement/1 mM pyruvate/0.1 mM nonessential amino acids/0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (<b>differentiation</b> medium). After trypsinization for 5 min at 37°C, partially dissociated ES cell clumps (10–50 cells/one clump) were plated on PA6 cells at a density of 500 clumps/10-cm dish and cultured in the <b>differentiation</b> medium for 3 weeks or indicated periods. Medium was changed every third day. Unlike mouse ES cells, monkey ES cells do not form colonies from single cells on PA6 cells. Low cloning efficiency has been also reported for human ES cells (12–14). It is therefore necessary to plate clumps of 10–50 undifferentiated ES cells for starting induction. Two independent ES cell lines (CMK 6 and 9; normal karyotypes) were used and found to give similar results. In some experiments, 0.5 nM BMP4 (R & D Systems) was added to the <b>differentiation</b> medium on day 0 and at each medium change.",
