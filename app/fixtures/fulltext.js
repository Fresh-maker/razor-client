\n# Abstract
\n
\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer great hope for in vitro modeling of Parkinson’s disease (PD), as well as for designing cell-replacement therapies. To realize these opportunities, there is an urgent need to develop efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of
\nhESC/iPSC into dopamine (DA) neurons with the specific characteristics of the cell
\npopulation lost to PD, i.e., A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons. Here we use
\nlentiviral vectors to drive the expression of LMX1A, which encodes a transcription
\nfactor critical for ventral midbrain identity, specifically in neural progenitor cells. We show that clonal lines of hESC engineered to contain one or two copies of this lentiviral vector retain long-term self- renewing ability and pluripotent differentiation capacity. Greater than 60% of all neurons generated from LMX1A-engineered hESC were ventral midbrain DA neurons of the A9 subtype, compared with *10% in green fluorescent protein–engineered controls, as judged by specific marker expression and functional analyses. Moreover, DA neuron precursors differentiated from LMX1A-engineered hESC were able to survive and differentiate when grafted into the brain of adult mice. Finally, we provide evidence that LMX1A overexpression similarly increases the yield of DA neuron differentiation from human iPSC. Taken together, our data show that stable genetic engineering of hESC/iPSC with lentiviral vectors driving controlled expression of LMX1A is an efficient way to generate enriched populations of human A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons, which should prove useful for modeling PD and may be helpful for designing future cell-replacement strategies.
\n
\n# Introduction
\n
\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable, chronically progressive condition characterized by the continuing degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons projecting from the midbrain substantia nigra to the basal ganglia striatum (Marsden, 1990). Current symptomatic therapies, consisting primarily of pharmacological DA replacement, compensate the movement deficit efficiently over a period of several years, but are ineffective in alleviating the loss of autonomic and cognitive abilities. Moreover, current treatments are met with late complications, which might be due, at least partially, to neurotoxicity of the drugs. The localized loss of a specialized neuronal cell popula- tion, paired with the urgent need for long-term treatment options, makes cell replacement therapy a promising approach to treat PD. Clinical trials involving grafting of embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue in PD patients have provided proof-of-concept for the feasibility of cell therapy in this disease (Lindvall and Bjo ̈rklund, 2004). However, this approach is not widely applicable owing to the limited supply of such tissues and to ethical concerns. Human pluripotent stem cells, such as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomson et al., 1998), have great potential regarding their therapeutic use for PD patients (Lee et al., 2000; Ying et al., 2003; Nat et al., 2007; Morizane et al., 2008). More recently, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by ectopic expression of a defined set of factors (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007; Aasen et al., 2008; Lowry et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008b) has enabled the deri- vation of patient-specific pluripotent cells, providing valu- able experimental platforms to model human disease (Dimos et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008a; Ebert et al., 2009; Soldner et al., 2009; Agarwal et al., 2010) and opening the possibility of implementing patient-matched cell-therapy applications (Hanna et al., 2007; Wernig et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2009). In addition, the possibility of genetically engineering human pluripotent stem cells to express potentially therapeutic molecules or to manipulate their differentiation toward a specific phenotype, which, for example, could be used to increase survival, differentiation, migration, and function of their progeny, creates new opportunities for the develop- ment of restorative treatment for PD patients.
\n
\nThe use of hESC/iPSC-based strategies to treat or model PD, however, is currently hampered by the lack of efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into DA neurons with the appropriate char- acteristics of A9- subtype ventral midbrain neurons, the neuronal cell type lost to PD (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010). A deeper understanding of DA neuron differentiation, patterning, and specialization will surely facilitate the gen- eration of an optimal cell source for cell replacement therapy and disease modeling for PD. During embryo development, midbrain DA neurons originate in the most ventral region of the midbrain and are patterned by local induction through the activity of signaling molecules such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), and wingless (WNT) (for review, see Smidt and Burbach, 2007). As a result of this, a characteristic region-specific makeup of transcrip-
\ntion factor expression is established in neural progenitors. Among them, the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (Lmx1a) is selectively expressed in the proliferating neural progenitors that give rise to ventral midbrain DA neurons in the mouse, and has been shown to play crucial roles in de- termining their fate (Andersson et al., 2006).
\n
\nMoreover, overexpression of Lmx1a in mouse embryonic stem cells greatly improved their differentiation toward ventral mid- brain DA neurons (Andersson et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2009; Friling et al., 2009), prompting the possibility of using LMX1A modulation to similarly direct the fate of hESC/ iPSC-derived neurons. In support of this possibility, LMX1A expression was found to be required for the midbrain DA neuron differentiation of hESC (Cai et al., 2009). In spite of these promising pieces of evidence, strategies for increasing DA neuron differentiation of human neural precursors or hESC by LMX1A overexpression have been met with limited success. Thus, transfection of LMX1A-expressing constructs in human neuroblastoma cell lines did not increase the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons (Cai et al., 2009). Similarly, retroviral overexpression of LMX1A in immortalized human midbrain progenitors only resulted in very marginal increases in DA neuron differentiation (Roy- bon et al., 2008).A possible caveat in previous attempts to overexpress LMX1A in human neural stem cells or hESC could be the low levels of transfection/transduction achieved in these notoriously hard-to-transfect cell lines. In this context, the use of lentiviral vectors (LVs) (Naldini et al., 1996), to obtain robust and sustained transgene expression in neural or pluripotent stem cells (Lois et al., 2002; Pfeifer et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2003; Consiglio et al., 2004),acquires particular relevance. Indeed, transduction of hESC-derived neural progenitors with LVs expressing LMX1A under the control of a constitutive phos- phoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter has been recently re- ported to promote the generation of ventral midbrain DA neurons (Friling et al., 2009).
\n
\nIn this study, we tested whether hESC/iPSC could be stably engineered using LVs so that they would overexpress LMX1A in neural progenitors when prompted to differentiate.
\n
\nWe show that hESC/iPSC engineered in this way maintain their normal growth characteristics and retain their pluripotent differentiation ability, as judged by in vitro differentiation and teratoma formation assays. Notably, the levels of LMX1A overexpression achieved in neural pro- genitors differentiated from engineered hESC/iPSC are sufficient to boost the generation of ventral midbrain DA neurons. Analyses of the phenotypic and physiological properties of these cells, as well as the ability of grafted cells to survive and integrate into the striatum of adult mouse brains, showed that LMX1A-induced DA neurons differen- tiated from hESC/iPSC are essentially similar to authentic ventral midbrain DA neurons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that LVs can be exploited to stably engineer hESC/iPSC for their directed differentiation toward specific DA neuron phenotypes, thus making it possible to develop new strategies for modeling and treating neurodegenerative diseases.

\n# Materials and Methods
\n
\n## Cell culture
\n
\nThe hESC lines (ES[2] and ES[4]) and the iPSC lines used in these studies have been previously described (Aasen et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2008, 2009). Human pluripotent stem cells were cultured on the top of irradiated (55 Gy) human fore- skin fibroblasts (CCD1112SK; ATCC), seeded at a density of 7 · 104 cells/cm2 on 10-cm cell culture dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin (Chemicon, Millipore, Temecula, CA). The hESC and hiPSC were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in hESC medium, consisting of KnockOut DMEM (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 0.5% human albumin (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 50 lM 2-mercap- toethanol (Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD), and 10ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Peprotech, Rock Hill, NJ). Medium was changed every day. Individual hESC and iPSC colonies were passed by mechanical dissociation using a 150-lm-diameter plastic pipette (The Stripper; Midatlantic Diagnostics, Mount Laurel, NJ) and replated every 5–7 days. Karyotyping was performed by incubating colonies for 30 min in 2 ll/ml Colcemid (Invitrogen) by the G banding method. Fifteen metaphases were analyzed for each line.
\n
\n## Plasmid construction, lentiviral production, and hESC and iPSC transduction
\n
\nLMX1A or green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was driven by the NESTIN enhancer (NesE) (1,852bp) and the basic herpes virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk)
\npromoter element (925 bp). This enhancer contains a sufficient cis-element that recapitulates endogenous NESTIN expression in the CNS (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997).
\nThe cassette containing the NesE, HSV tk promoter, and Lmx1a cDNA was cloned in the CSC.cPPT.hCMV.GFP.Wpre LV backbone previously described (Lie et al., 2005). High-titer vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)–pseudotyped LV stocks were produced in 293T cells by calcium phosphate–mediated transient transfection of the transfer vector pRRL-SIN-PPT-NesE-Lmx1a-ires-GFP- WPRE, the late generation packaging construct pMDL, and the VSV envelope–expressing construct pMD2.G, and puri- fied by ultracentrifugation as previously described (Con- siglio et al., 2004). Expression titers, determined using HeLa cells by FACS analysis, were 5 · 108 to 1 · 109 transducing units (TU)/ml with an average HIV-1 p24 concentration of 100 lg/ml. The same day of transduction, 2 · 105 hESC (passage 15) were infected in suspension at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP, LV.NES.GFP, or LV.PGK.GFP in the presence of 6lg/ml Polybrene (Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO). The day after transduction, the medium was changed and transduction efficiency was estimated by FACS analysis for GFP
\nexpression.
\n
\n## DA differentiation of hESC
\n
\nFor neural induction, embryoid bodies (EBs) were gener- ated from large colony fragments obtained by mechanical splitting with a finely drawn Pasteur pipette and
\ncultured in nonadherent dishes for 3–4 days in the presence of hES medium. At Stage 2, EBs were cultured 10 days in suspen- sion in N2B27 medium consisting of DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen), Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), 0.5 · B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5· N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 2mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). In this stage, N2B27 medium was supple- mented with 10ng/ml bFGF, 100ng/ml FGF8 (Peprotech), and 100 ng/ml SHH (Invitrogen). Finally, at Stage 3 for DA neuron maturation, the neural precursors cells (NPCs) were cocultured with PA6 for 3 weeks in N2B27 medium sup- plemented with FGF8 and SHH.
\n
\n## In vitro differentiation toward the embryonic germ layers
\n
\nDifferentiation toward endoderm, mesoderm, and neu- roectoderm was carried out essentially as described (Raya et al., 2010).Teratoma formation in nude mice
\nSevere combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used to test the teratoma induction capacity of hES-LMX1A cells essentially as described (Raya et al., 2008). All animal experiments were conducted following experimental protocols previously ap- proved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals, in full compliance with Spanish and European laws and regulations. In brief, *1–3 · 106 hES- LMX1A cells were injected subcutaneously into the testis of SCID mice anesthetized with isoflurane. Five to 8 weeks after injection, teratomas were dissected, fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin phosphate, and embedded in paraffin.
\n
\n## RT-PCR analysis
\n
\nTotal mRNA was isolated by guanidinium thiocynate– phenol–chloroform extraction (TRIzol; Invitrogen) and trea- ted with DNase I. One microgram was used to synthesize cDNA by using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was done in triplicate on 50ng by using Platinum SYBER Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) in an ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). All results were nor- malized to the average expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and B-2-MICROGLOBULIN. Results were obtained from three or four technical replicates of three or four independent biological samples at each data point. Transcript-specific primers used were as follows: B2M, 5’-GCCGTGTGAACCATGTGACT-3’ and 5’-GCTTACATGT CTCGATCCCACTT-3’; HPRT,5’-TATGGACAGGACTGAACGTCTTG-3’ and 5’-GCACACAGAGGGCTACAATGTG- 3’; LMX1A, 5’-AGGAAGGCAAGGACCATAAGC-3’ and 5’- ATGCTCGCCTCTGTTGAGTTG- 3’; PAX6, 5’-GCTTCAC CATGGCAAATAACC-3’ and 5’-GGCAGCATGCAGGAG TATGA-3’; SOX1, 5’-TACGT TTATTTCAGCAGCCTTAGG- 3’ and 5’-TCCAGGACAAGGAAGGGTGTT-3’; NURR1, 5’- CGCCTGTAACTCGGCTGAAG-3’ and 5’-CTTGAGGCGAGGACCCATAC-3’; ALDH1A1, 5’-TGACAAGATCCAGGGCCGTACAAT-3’ and 5’-TGAGAGGAGTTTGCTCTGCTGGTT-3’; EN1, 5’-CAGACCCATAATCCTGCATTTCTC-3’ and 5’-TTTGGGATGTAGGCAAATGGA-3’; OCT4, 5’-GGA GGAAGCTGACAACAATGAAA-3’ and 5’-GGCCTGCACGAGGGTTT-3’; NANOG, 5’-ACAACTGGCCGAAGAATA GCA-3’ and 5’-GGTTCCCAGTCGGGTTCAC-3’; TH, 5’-CCGAGCTGTGAAGGTGTTTGA-3’ and 5’-CGGGCCGGGTC TCTAGAT-3’; IRES, 5’-TGTGAGGGCCCGGAAAC-3’ and 5’-GGGAAAGACCCCTAGGAATGC-3’; UTR, 5’-CCTTGG CTCTTCCTTCCAACT-3’ and 5’-ATGGCTGCTGGGTCTTC TGT-3’.
\n
\n## DNA extraction, Southern, and integration analysis
\n
\nDNA isolation was performed with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Southern analysis, the genomic DNA was digested overnight with 40U of PstI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a neutral nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham, GE Healthcare Limited, Buckingham- Shire) by capillary transfer, and hybridized with a GFP di- goxigenin (DIG)–2’-deoxyuridine 5’-triphosphate–labeled probe generated by PCR using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The probe was detected by an alkaline phosphatase–conjugated DIG-Antibody (Roche Diagnostics) using CDP-Star (Sigma- Aldrich) as a substrate for chemiluminescence. The GFP probe was generated using an eGFP template with the primers GFP-F 5’- CGCACCATCTT CTTCAAGGAC-3’ and GFP-R 5’-CATGCCGAGAGTGATC CCG-3’. Quantification of transgene copy number per cell was analyzed by qPCR using Platinum SYBER Green qPCR Su- perMix (Invitrogen) in an ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). To determine the number of integrations, primers specific for the transgene sequence were generated: IRES-F, 5’-TGTGAGGGCCCGGAAAC-3’ and IRES-R 5’-GGGAAAGACCCC TAGGAATGC-3’. To quantify the number of cells, B-ACTIN primers were used: B-ACTIN-F 5’-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3’ and B-ACTIN-R 5’-ACA GTCTCCACTCACCC AG GA-3’. To measure the average proviral DNA per transduced cell, two standard curves were made: one employing a known amount of the LV (LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP) using the IRES primers, and a second curve employing a known number of cells and the B-ACTIN primers. Next, the average proviral number per cell was estimated by interpo- lation of the IRES-to-B-ACTIN ratio from each DNA sample in the two standard curves.
\n
\n## Immunochemistry and cell counts
\n
\nhESC and iPSC were grown on plastic cover-slide chambers for immunostaining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformalde- hyde and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris- buffered saline. Cells were then blocked in 0.5% Triton X-100 with 3% donkey serum for 2 hr before incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Tra-1-60 (Chemicon; 1:100), mouse anti-Tra-1-81 (Chemicon; 1:100), rabbit anti-Sox2 (Chemicon; 1:500), rabbit anti-GAD (Chemicon; 1:1,000), mouse anti-HNA (Chemicon; 1:200), rabbit anti-calbindin (Chemicon; 1:1,000), rabbit anti- Nestin (Chemicon;1:200), rat anti-DAT ( Millipore; 1:400, Hudson, WI), mouse anti-SSEA-4 (MC-813-70, 1:2), and mouse anti-SSEA-3 (MC-631, 1:2) (from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), rabbit anti-TH (Sigma; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-
\nGirk2 (Sigma; 1:40), mouse anti- ACTA1 (Sigma; 1:400), mouse anti-SMA (Sigma;
\n1:400), rabbit anti-a-fetoprotein (1:400), rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako; 1:1,000, Dako, Denmark), mouse anti-Tuj1, (Covance; 1:500, Emery- ville, California), mouse anti-Oct-3/4 (Santa Cruz; 1:100), rabbit anti-Gata4 (Santa Cruz; 1:50), goat anti-Nanog (Everest Biotech; 1:100, Oxford-Shire, UK), goat anti-FoxA2 (R&D Biosystems; 1:100), chicken anti-GFP (AveLabs; 1:200), rabbit anti-5-HT (Immunostar; 1:2,000), mouse anti-synaptophysin (Millipore; 1:500, Hudson, WI), rabbit anti-DBH (Chemicon; 1:200), and rabbit anti-Lmx1a (kindly provided by Dr. M.S. German, University of California, San Francisco Diabetes Center). Secondary antibodies used were all the Alexa Fluor Series from Invitrogen (all 1:500). Images were taken using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. For quantification of stained cells, 300 cells per differentiated aggregate were randomly counted (average six to eight differentiated aggregates per experiment). Data points represent the average of at least three independent experiments.
\n
\n## Transplantation in immunodeficient mice
\n
\nTwenty 6-week-old SCID beige mice were anesthetized and stereotaxically injected with 2· 105 cells at Stage 3 in 2 ll using a Hamilton syringe in the striatum. The cells were injected at 1 ll/min rate. Mice were sacrificed at 1 month (n = 11) and 5 months (n = 8) after transplantation. Upon sacrifice, animals were perfused transcardially with paraformaldehyde (4%), and the brains sectioned at 20lm on a freezing microtome and stained with antibodies as previously described. Brain sections were analyzed for the presence of immunoreactive cells along the entire length of the graft. All animal experiments were conducted following experimental protocols previously approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals, in full compliance with Spanish and European laws and regulations.
\n
\n## DA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
\n
\nLevels of DA were quantified using an ELISA kit obtained from Rocky Mountain Diagnostics (Colorado Springs, CO; http://www.rmdiagnostics.com) according to the
\nmanufacturer’s instructions. In brief, after being rinsed in a low-KCl (4.7 mM) solution, the cells were incubated in 1 ml of a high- KCl (60mM) solution for 15min at 37°C. After stimulation with high potassium, DA was measured by ELISA analysis, as previously described (Trzaska et al., 2007).
\n
\n##  Electrophysiology recordings
\n
\nElectrophysiology studies were performed using E2 Technology (Aleria Biodevices, Barcelona, Spain). In brief, the cells are cultured in a plate composed of pairs of wells connected through a 1-mm-long microchannel, cells are seeded in the wells, and axons sprout all along the micro- channel. For recording, one electrode is located in each well. NPCs were seeded in the wells on the top of PA6; 3 weeks later, recordings in loose patch mode were obtained (Mor- ales et al., 2008).

\n## In vitro differentiation of DA neurons from hESC/iPSC
\n
\nIn a first series of experiments, we used the ES[4] hESC line previously derived in ourlaboratory (Raya et al. 2008), maintained by mechanical passaging on top of feeder layers of irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. To promote DA neuron differentiation, we implemented a three-stage pro- tocol involving (1) hESC aggregation (via EB formation), (2) neural induction, and (3) DA neuron maturation using a PA6 feeder-based system (Kawasaki et al., 2002) (Fig. 1a). Speci- fically, neural induction was carried out by incubating EBs in suspension for 10 days in a defined medium supplemented with FGF2, SHH, and FGF8 (Ying et al., 2003; Roy et al., 2006) (Fig. 1b). After that, in Stage 2, NPCs positive for early neural markers, such as NESTIN and SOX2, started to become ap-
\nparent in the dish (Fig. 1c and d). To achieve DA neuron maturation, NPCs were then treated in Stage 3 with FGF8/ SHH and plated on top of PA6 cells. At this stage and under these conditions, almost 50% of the cells expressed the neu- ronal marker TUJ1, of which *50% were of DA lineage as judged by TH expression (Fig. 1e). In our hands, differentiation of hESC in monolayer (e.g., without EB formation) or in the absence of PA6 coculture resulted in poor DA neuron yield ( < 10% of the differentiated cells were neurons, of which < 25% were DA neurons; Fig. 1f ). Similarly, supplementation with FGF2 during the entire differentiation pro- tocol resulted in fewer neurons and DA neurons compared with conditions where FGF2 was withdrawn during Stage 3 (Fig. 1f).
\n
\nAs expected, the expression of SSEA-3 and TRA-1-81, markers of undifferentiated hESC, dramatically declined during the differentiation process, so that only 0.1% of the cells expressed both markers at the end of the protocol, as judged by flow cytometry (Fig. 1g). We confirmed these results by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses of OCT4 expression, which also showed a marked decrease as dif- ferentiation proceeded (Fig. 1h). To test whether our differentiation could be applied to other lines of human pluripotent stem cells with comparable results, we subjected an additional hESC line {ES[2] (Raya et al., 2008)} and two independent lines of iPSC [KiPS4F#1 and cFA404FiPS4F#1 (Aasen et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2009, respectively)] to the same protocol and harvested samples at different time points for analyses of gene expression. The behavior of all four hESC/ iPSC lines was similar in terms of the decrease in OCT4 ex- pression and the up-regulation of neural and neuronal markers (Fig. 1h). Specifically, markers of neural precursors such as PAX6 and SOX1 were found up-regulated in all cell lines tested, peaking at the end of Stage 2 or the first week of Stage 3, whereas markers of DA neuron phenotype such as TH peaked at later time points. The expression of LMX1A, encoding a key transcription factor for midbrain identity (Andersson et al., 2006), showed an intermediate profile, with maximum levels reached between weeks 2 and 3 of Stage 3 (Fig. 1i–l). These results show that we have optimized a protocol for DA neuron differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells that is applicable to both hESC and iPSC, and that achieves DA neuron
\ndifferentiation efficiencies in the range of previously published protocols (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010). However, and also in agreement with previous reports (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010), DA neurons generated with our protocol were not the majority of the specific subtype lost in PD (i.e., A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons), as judged by the expression of G protein–activated inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK2; encoded by potassium channel, inwardly rectifying, subfamily j, member 6; KCNJ6) (Inanobe et al., 1999; Mendez et al., 2005) (see below).
\n
\n## Achieving neural-specific overexpression of LMX1A
\n
\nTherefore, we next asked whether delivering the ventral midbrain DA lineage-associated transcription LMX1A to human pluripotent stem cells could provide appropriate regionalization cues during their differentiation. For this pur- pose, we generated an LV
\n(LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP; Fig. 2a) in which LMX1A expression is driven by a neural NESTIN enhancer, active in neural progenitor cells (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997) and a minimal TK promoter. The vector also expressed GFP downstream of an IRES element, to allow monitoring of the transgenic expression of LMX1A during the differentiation process. After transduction of hESC with this LV at an MOI of 50, GFP expression was not observed in undifferentiated hESC, whereas it could be clearly detected by epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry during the early steps of neural differentiation (Fig. 2b and c). In contrast, >90% of hESC transduced in parallel with LVs expressing GFP from a constitutive PGK promoter (LV.PGK.GFP) displayed strong GFP expression in both the undifferentiated state and during neural differentiation (Fig. 2b and c). The specificity of the LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP con- struct in hESC undergoing neural differentiation was further confirmed by testing coimmunolocalization of GFP and NESTIN (Fig. 2d). To investigate the effect of LMX1A overexpression during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, we sub- jected hESC tranduced with LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP to our three-stage DA neuron differentiation protocol, and com- pared the overall yield of neurons and DA neurons with those of hESC transduced with a control (LV.NES.GFP) virus. Whereas no overt differences were found in the total number of neurons in each condition at the end of Stage 3, hESC overexpressing LMX1A generated a significantly higher proportion of DA neurons (Fig. 2e). However, the increased DA neuron differentiation of LV.NES.LM- X1A.GFP transduced hESC was progressively lost as cells were passaged (Fig. 2e), concomitant with a decrease in the levels of transgenic LMX1A overexpression (Fig. 2f), sug- gesting silencing of the LV transgenes and/or selection of untransduced hESC upon passaging.
\n
\n## Generation of hESC clones overexpressing LMX1A
\n
\nTo circumvent the loss of LMX1A expression in bulk- transduced hESC, we set out to generate clonal lines of LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP-transduced hESC (hES-LMX1A cells). As controls, stable cell lines transduced with LV.NES.GFP were generated (mock-hESC). In order to obtain hESC colo- nies derived from single cells, 5 days after infection (MOI 10) cells were trypsinized to single cells and serial dilutions plated on human feeder fibroblasts in six-well plates. Be- tween 3 and 6 weeks after plating, colonies of tightly packed cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and hESC-like morphology appeared in those cultures. We picked and ex- panded nine independent colonies from wells in which only two to four colonies had grown. The number of lentiviral integration(s) in each clonal line were first screened by qPCR on genomic DNA using primers specific to the IRES se- quence and normalized for b-actin (see Materials and Methods for details). From the nine clones analyzed, five of them (clones A, C, G, H, and K) showed no lentiviral inte- grations, three of them (clones B, L, and I) contained a single lentiviral integration, and one (clone D) showed two inte- grations. The accuracy of this PCR-based screen was con- firmed in selected clones by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 3a). We selected clones D and L of transgenic hES-LMX1A cells for a thorough characterization and first tested whether the LV transduction could support undifferentiated hESC culture for extended periods of time. After 32 passages, or 8 months in continuous culture, transgenic hES-LMX1A cells maintained a normal 46-XY karyotype (Fig. 3b and data not shown) and remained undifferentiated and pluripotent, as judged by the expression of pluripotency-associated markers OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, and surface markers SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-81 (Fig. 3c–e and data not shown), and the ability to differentiate in vitro into derivatives of the three main embryonic germ layers (Fig. 3f–h and data not shown). In addition, injection of clone D hESC into immunocom- promised mice resulted in complex teratomas containing derivatives from all three germ layers, further confirming that transgenic hES-LMX1A cells were pluripotent (Fig. 3i– k). Overall, these results show that genetic manipulation of hESC with LVs expressing LMX1A under the control of a neural NESTIN enhancer does not cause any conspicuous deleterious effect in their self-renewing or pluripotent differentiation abilities.

\n## Effect of neural-specific overexpression of LMX1A on DA neuron differentiation
\n
\nTransgenic clones of hES-LMX1A cells showed a robust overexpression of LMX1A under DA neuron differentiation conditions, reaching levels of up to 10-fold higher than those of mock-hESC (Fig. 4a). During the course of DA neuron differentiation, both hES-LMX1A and mock-hESC showed a progressive decline in the expression of pluripotency- associated genes such as NANOG, until levels were barely detectable (Fig. 4b). However, the increase in the expression of genes associated with DA neuron differentiation, such as nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group a, member 2 [NR4A2, en- coding nuclear receptor-related 1 (NURR1)], engrailed 1 (EN1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1), and TH, was significantly more pronounced in hES-LMX1A cells when compared with mock-hESC (Fig. 4c–f),suggesting that more cells were being specified to a DA neuron lineage. We directly addressed this possibility by analyzing the expression of relevant markers (Isacson et al., 2003) at various time points of the differentiation protocol by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4g–p). As expected, more LMX1A-positive cells were found in differentiating hES-LMX1A cells in comparison with mock-hESC at Stage 2 (Fig. 4g and h). Moreover, at the end of Stage 3, hES-LMX1A cells generated > 25% more DA neurons than mock-hESC (Fig. 4i and j), as evaluated by quantifying the number of TH/TUJ1 double-positive cells (Fig. 4q). Importantly, the majority of DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A cells, but not from mock-hESC, presented the typical bipolar morphology of mDA neurons, stained positive for FOXA2, coexpressed the A9-subtype marker GIRK2, and were mature, as judged by coexpression of DA transporter (DAT) (Fig. 4k–p). In contrast, DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A cells did not express the A10-subtype markercalbindin, although some calbindin- expressing neurons were observed, whereas this marker was frequently coexpressed in mock-hESC-derived DA neurons (Fig. 4r and s).DA neurons differentiated from either hES- LMX1A cells or mock-hESC did not express the marker of adrenergic neurons dopamine-b-hydroxylase (DBH, Fig. 4t and u), or serotonin (5-HT), marker of serotonergic neurons (Fig. 4v and w). Functional characterization of DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A cells We next tested whether DA neurons allowed to differ- entiate fully in vitro (end of Stage 3) displayed the func- tional characteristics expected from bona fide DA neurons. For this purpose, we analyzed their ability to release DA in response to appropriate stimuli. Cells differentiated from either hES-LMX1A or mock-hESC (but not undifferentiated cells) showed robust DA release induced by a depolarizing solution of KCl (60 mM; see Fig. 4x). Next, we analyzed the electrophysiological properties of DA neurons through extracellular recordings using the E2 Technology, in which 10–50 axons grow within a
\nmicrochannel and allow si- multaneous recording of multiple neurons (Morales et al.,2008). These studies showed that cells differentiated from either hES-LMX1A or mock- hESC, but not undifferentiated cells, fired spontaneous action potentials, providing evidence that these cells are, indeed, functional neurons. Moreover, cells differentiated from hES-LMX1A, but not from mock-hESC, responded to the application of DA with a marked reduction in spontaneous firing activity (Fig. 4y), a behavior characteristic of midbrain DA neurons (Friling et al., 2009). Taken together, our results so far show that clones of hESC engineered to overexpress LMX1A in neural precursors, when subject to our optimized protocol for DA neuron differentiation, efficiently generate DA neurons that are molecularly and functionally of the ventral midbrain A9 subtype. To investigate the functional properties of DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A and mock-hESC, we first tested their ability to engraft and survive within the context of the adult brain. For this purpose, we transplanted 2 · 105 differentiating hESC at mid-Stage 3 (after 2 weeks of cocul- ture with PA6 cells) directly into the striatum of unlesioned mice.One month after transplantation, grafted cells identi- fied by GFP expression (Fig. 5a),immunofluorescence against TUJ1/TH (Fig. 5b), and antibodies against human nuclear antigen (HNA) (Fig. 5c) were found at the expected position in 10 of 11 mice. To analyze longer grafting times, we retained four mice injected with mock-hESC and four mice injected with hES-LMX1A cells for an additional 4 months. In all eight animals, we found viable grafts con- taining human TH-positive cells (Fig. 5d–f), although their numbers were much higher in those injected with hES- LMX1A cells (compare Fig. 5e and f).Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the vast majority of TH positive cells found in the engrafted hES- LMX1A cells 5 months after transplantation were mature A9-subtype DA neurons, as shown by coexpression of GIRK2 and DAT (Fig. 5g). Consistentwith this, we did not detect GABAergic or serotonergic neurons in the grafted area (Fig.5h and i).
\n
\n# Discussion
\n
\nOne of the major bottlenecks to the development of hESC/ iPSC-based strategies for modeling and treating human disease is the relative lack of efficient directed differentiation protocols for generating the specific cell type(s) relevant to the disease. In the case of PD, a variety of protocols have been described that promote the differentiation of hESC/ iPSC toward DA neurons (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010), but in most cases these were not appropriately patterned as A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons, the relevant cell type for PD. Forcing the expression of patterning- and/or fate- associated transcription factors may help overcome this limitation, as evidenced by studies in which Lmx1a (An- dersson et al., 2006; Friling et al., 2009) or a combination of Nurr1 and Pitx3 (Martinat et al., 2006) or Nurr1 and Foxa2 (Lee et al., 2010) was overexpressed in mouse neural pre- cursor cells. Here, we decided to focus on LMX1A, because it was the only transcription factor the overexpression of which had been shown to clearly increase the percentage of ventral midbrain DA neurons differentiated from human neural progenitors (Friling et al., 2009). In this latter work, hESC- derived neural progenitors were transduced with LVs ex- pressing Lmx1a under a constitutive PGK promoter. Building on these data, we decided to exploit the ability of LVs to provide long-term and robust transgene expression in plu- ripotent stem cells and neural progenitors (Lois et al., 2002; Pfeifer et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2003; Consiglio et al., 2004), as well as the selectivity of expression in neural progenitor cells conferred by the neural NESTIN enhancer (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997; Andersson et al., 2006), to address whether: (1) human pluripotent stem cells can be stably engineered to express LMX1A while maintaining their characteristic self- renewal and pluripotent differentiation abilities; and (2) ex- pression of LMX1A in the context of engineered hESC/iPSC is sufficient to direct the fate of differentiating neural progenitors toward ventral midbrain DA neurons of the A9 subtype.
\n
\nOn the first issue, our results show that clonal lines of hESC containing one or two copies of the integrated LMX1A- expressing LVs retain the typical features of nonmanipulated hESC, including colony morphology and growth character- istics, long-term self-renewing ability while maintaining a stable karyotype, expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and surface markers, in vitro differenti- ation into derivatives of the three main embryo germ layers, and teratoma formation ability (Fig. 3). This is particularly important because, even though we confirmed the specificity of expression of the neural NESTIN enhancer in neural progenitors (Fig. 2), there was measurable expression of trans- genic LMX1A in undifferentiated hESC (Fig. 4a), probably owing to leakage of our system. Therefore, it is important to note that the somewhat higher levels of LMX1A expression in undifferentiated hES-LMX1A cells, compared with mock- hESC, do not appear to be detrimental for their maintenance as undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells, even upon long- term passaging.
\n
\nHowever, when induced to differentiate toward neuronal fates, hES-LMX1A cells generated significantly higher num- bers of DA neurons than mock-hESC (*40% more, based on TH/TUJ1 double staining) and, more importantly, most of these DA neurons were of the ventral midbrain A9 subtype (up to 75% of them, compared with *25% in the case of mock-hESC, based on colabeling of TH and GIRK2). Con- sequently, of 100 hES-LMX1A cells, we obtained >30 A9- subtype DA neurons, versus approximately seven from mock-hESC, that is, close to a fivefold increase in the overall yield of the differentiation procedure. These differences are consistent with more differentiating cells being recruited into the ventral midbrain DA neuron lineage as transgenic LMX1A begins to be expressed in neural precursors, as evi- denced by the increased numbers of LMX1A-positive cells in Stage 2 of differentiation.
\n
\nOur results show that, under ventralizing conditions such as exposure to SHH, LMX1A is sufficient to direct the dif- ferentiation of human neural progenitors toward ventral midbrain DA neurons. This is in agreement with previous studies in the mouse, conducted by the Ericson laboratory (Andersson et al., 2006; Friling et al., 2009), and also in human cells (Friling et al., 2009). Therefore, the reported failure of other groups to induce human DA neuron differentiation by overexpressing LMX1A (Roybon et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2009) is likely the result of inadequate levels of expression of this factor, due either to low transfection efficiency (Cai et al., 2009) or to strong overexpression driven by retroviruses (Roybon et al., 2008). In this regard, it is important to note that the levels of LMX1A expression achieved in our clonal hES-LMX1A cell lines harboring one or two LV integrations are in the same range of endogenous LMX1A expression levels during DA differentiation. Thus, LMX1A expression in hES-LMX1A cells, at its peak in mid-Stage 3, is roughly only three times higher than that of mock-hESC (Fig. 4a). Taking into account that, as discussed above, the number of cells undergoing A9 DA neuron differentiation is about five times higher in hES-LMX1A cells than in mock-hESC, it follows that the levels of LMX1A expression per cell should be within the same order of magnitude in either case.
\n
\nOur results also show that hES-LMX1A cells committed to DA lineages in vitro are able to complete differentiation to A9 ventral midbrain DA neurons upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. We transplanted differentiating cells at mid-Stage 3 (after 2 weeks of coculture with PA6 cells), because we surmised that cells at this stage of differentiation, at which they express high levels of NURR1, EN1, ALDH1A1, and TH (see Fig. 4c–f), would have become depleted of undifferentiated progenitors but were not yet fully differentiated, thus making them more likely to survive after grafting. Indeed, viable grafted cells were recovered 5 months after transplantation and shown to have completed differentiation in situ. Conversely, mock-hESC pre- treated in vitro under the same conditions and transplanted into adult mouse brains differentiated very poorly in vivo, in agreement with previous reports that highlighted the inability of adult brain tissue to direct transplanted human neural progenitors to acquire the DA neuron fate (Ben-Hur et al., 2004). Therefore, in the absence of appropriate environmental cues, transgenic LMX1A expression appears to maintain a ventral midbrain DA neuron differentiation program in hES-LMX1A cells.
\n
\nOur strategy of LV-mediated engineering of human plu- ripotent stem cells to overexpress LMX1A in neural pro- genitors provides an efficient way to generate enriched populations of neurons with the characteristics of A9 ventral midbrain DA neurons. As this strategy is applicable to both hESC and iPSC, it should be suitable for modeling PD pathogenesis in vitro, as well as worth considering when designing future cell-therapy applications for this disease.

\n(a) Schematic representation of the different stages for the in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells toward DA neurons. At Stage 1, EBs are formed by aggregation. At Stage 2, NPCs are obtained culturing the EBs in suspension with N2B27 medium supplemented with FGF2, FGF8, and SHH. At Stage 3, NPCs are cocultured with PA6 for 3 weeks and DA neurons are generated. (b) NPCs formed at Stage 2 express the neural precursor markers NESTIN (c) and SOX2 (d). (e) At Stage 3, some of the TUJ1-positive cells generated coexpress TH. (f) Omitting the EB generation step or the coculture with PA6 cells results in < 10% of the cells differentiating to neurons, of which *24% are TH- positive. Better results are obtained with the addition of FGF2 during the coculture with PA6; the number of neurons generated is 14% and 40% of the neurons stained for TH. With the three stage protocol implemented in (a), the yield of neurons generated increases to 48% and the TH-positive neurons to 50%. (g) Flow cytometry analysis shows that, in the undifferentiated state, 90% of the cells are positive for TRA-1-81 or SSEA-3. This value is reduced to 38% in NPCs and to 10% at the first week in coculture with PA6. At 3 weeks in coculture with PA6, 99% of the cells are double negative, thus indicating that mainly all of the cells have entered into the differentiation process. (h) A decrease or inactivation of the expression of the pluripotency marker OCT4 is found as the differentiation occurs. (i, j) The neural precursor markers PAX6 and SOX1 show activation in NPCs, and the expression starts to decay at 3 weeks in coculture with PA6. (k) The DA progenitor marker LMX1A starts to be expressed in NPCs, but reaches the maximum level of expression during coculture with PA6. (l) TH levels of expression are first detected in NPCs, and its expression is maintained or grows until the end of the protocol. *p < 0.05. Scale bar = 50 lm. In all experiments, n = 3.

Relative levels of expression of the pluripotency marker NANOG (b) are similar in both lines. Higher levels of NURR1 (c), EN1 (d), ALDH1A1 (e), and TH (f ) are observed in hES-LMX1A compared with mock-hESC. (g–w) hESC are differentiated and analyzed at different stages of the DA protocol. (g, h) Staining for LMX1A at Stage 2 is more prominent in hES-LMX1A than in mock-hESC. Staining at the end of the protocol for TH and TUJ1 (i, j), TH and GIRK2 (k, l), and TH and DAT (m, n), show a higher number of TH-, GIRK2-, and DAT-positive neurons in hES- LMX1A as compared with mock-hES. Only hES-LMX1A in Stage 3 present TH-positive neurons with staining of FOXA2 in the nucleus, a feature typical of mDA neurons but not mock-hES (o, p). (q) Quantification of TUJ1, TH, and GIRK2 expression at the end of the protocol. The expression of TUJ1 is *55% in both infected lines. Approximately 55% of mock-hESC TUJ1-positive cells expressed TH, and this amount increased to 80% in hES-LMX1A.

\n### Abstract
\n
\nThe curry spice curcumin plays a protective role in mouse models of neurodegenerative dis- eases, and can also directly modulate aggregation of α-synuclein protein in vitro, yet no studies have described the interaction of curcumin and α-synuclein in genetic synucleinopa- thy mouse models. Here we examined the effect of chronic and acute curcumin treatment in the Syn-GFP mouse line, which overexpresses wild-type human α-synuclein protein. We discovered that curcumin diet intervention significantly improved gait impairments and re- sulted in an increase in phosphorylated forms of α-synuclein at cortical presynaptic termi- nals. Acute curcumin treatment also caused an increase in phosphorylated α-synuclein in terminals, but had no direct effect on α-synuclein aggregation, as measured by in vivo multi- photon imaging and Proteinase-K digestion. Using LC-MS/MS, we detected ~5 ng/mL and ~12 ng/mL free curcumin in the plasma of chronic or acutely treated mice, with a glucuroni- dation rate of 94% and 97%, respectively. Despite the low plasma levels and extensive me- tabolism of curcumin, these results show that dietary curcumin intervention correlates with significant behavioral and molecular changes in a genetic synucleinopathy mouse model that mimics human disease.
\n
\n### Introduction
\n
\nCurcumin, the main component of turmeric spice, is a natural compound found in the root of the Curcuma longa plant. Of the three main curcuminoids found in the turmeric root, curcu- min is the most abundant and the most biologically active. Much research has demonstrated that this polyphenolic compound has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic properties. These properties are particularly relevant for treatment of neurodegenerative dis- eases, and curcumin has been shown to alleviate cell death and neuronal loss in cellular and an- imal models of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s Disease, and stroke [1,2]. Curcumin has been extensively studied in mouse models of AD, where it has been shown to reduce A-beta plaque size, reduce soluble A-beta, suppress soluble tau dimers, and lower oxidative stress [3–6]. While studies in mouse models of PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) are more limited, experiments from a toxin-induced mouse model of PD show that curcumin reverses neurodegeneration by blocking mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [7].
\n
\nIn addition to promoting mitochondrial health and reducing oxidative stress, curcumin may be beneficial in PD and DLB by directly modulating aggregation of α-synuclein protein. α-synuclein is the most abundant protein found in Lewy Bodies (LBs), the pathological hall- mark of PD and DLB, and is genetically and molecularly linked to neurodegeneration in both human patients and mouse models of disease [8,9]. Curcumin protects against α-synuclein-in- duced cell death in tissue culture cells by inhibiting mitochondrial toxicity and formation of re- active oxygen species [10,11]. Furthermore, curcumin directly binds to α-synuclein in vitro, and can both inhibit and reverse the formation of toxic α-synuclein aggregate species [12]. Mo- lecular interaction studies reveal that curcumin binds to the non-amyloid-beta component (NAC) domain of α-synuclein to shield hydrophobic residues that drive self-aggregation, thus promoting and stabilizing non-aggregate forms of the protein in vitro [13]. Ahmad and col- leagues also found that curcumin could dis-aggregate higher-order oligomeric and fibrillar forms of the protein, which are thought to be the toxic species. Because curcumin can dis-ag- gregate pre-formed α-synuclein aggregates, this suggests curcumin could potentially be used therapeutically, not just preventatively, to halt or reverse the disease process after it has already caused clinical symptoms.
\nTo date, the effect of curcumin in genetic mouse models of PD, DLB, and related synuclei- nopathies that closely mimic human disease, has not been examined. We use transgenic mice with 2-3-fold over-expression of human GFP-tagged wild-type α-synuclein (Syn-GFP), which mimics duplication and triplication mutations found in some human patients [14,15]. Using a combination of in vivo multi-photon imaging through a cranial window and biochemical anal- ysis of fresh and fixed brain tissue, we have previously characterized a pool of phosphorylated Syn-GFP microaggregates in cortical presynaptic terminals from these mice [15]. In this study, we examined the effect of both chronic and acute curcumin treatment on motor behavior, α- synuclein phosphorylation, and aggregation in these mice. We found that a moderate dose of dietary curcumin significantly improved the motor phenotype of Syn-GFP mice, and that this correlated with an increase in phosphorylated α-synuclein protein at cortical presynaptic ter- minals. We further found that acute treatment of curcumin for 2 weeks via i.p. injection did not significantly affect Syn-GFP aggregates in vivo or in fixed and fresh brain tissue, but did have the same effect of increasing phosphorylated α-synuclein. Combined these results indicate that curcumin intervention promotes phosphorylation of α-synuclein, which may contribute to improved motor behavior over time.

\n## Experimental Procedures
\n### Mice
\nMice were housed by Oregon Health and Science University’s Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM) or the Veterans Affairs Medical Center’s Veterinary Medical Unit, held in a light-dark cycle, temperature- and humidity-controlled animal vivarium, and maintained under ad libitum food and water diet supplied by the DCM. Syn-GFP (PDNG78 line; [14]) het- erozygous male mice were mated to BDF1 females from Charles River Laboratories. Male and female mice between 3 and 10 months old were used for experiments. All experiments were ap- proved by the OHSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number: IS01185) and every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
\nChronic and acute curcumin treatments. Mouse diet containing 500 ppm dietary supple- ment grade curcumin (Chromadex, Irvine, CA), premixed in soybean oil prior to incorporation into the diet, or control diet containing an equal amount of oil without curcumin, was made by Harlan Teklad. For chronic treatment, age matched male and female mice (n = 2 per sex per treatment group) were placed on the modified diet at 3 months of age, and were maintained on the diet for 6 months until the time of sacrifice. Mice were single housed, and animals and diet were weighed every day for 5 days at the start of the diet intervention, then weekly thereafter to measure weight gain and consumption. For acute curcumin treatment, mice with previously installed cranial windows were treated with 15 mg/kg/day dietary supplement grade curcumin or 50% DMSO/D-PBS vehicle control i.p. daily for 15 days. Mice were given soft food and daily i.p. injections of D-PBS to maintain hydration for the duration of the treatment. Imaging ex- periments were performed one day prior to the start of treatment, and at 7 and 14 days of treat- ment. On day 15 of treatment, mice were sacrificed 5 hours after the last curcumin or DMSO injection.
\n
\n## Behavioral Analysis
\n
\n1 day prior to behavioral testing, mice were acclimated to the testing room for 30 minutes. Gait analysis was performed on a DigiGait treadmill (Mouse Specifics, Quincy, MA), with a speed of 24 cm/sec, with 2–4 seconds of video analyzed for each mouse. In between animals, the treadmill was wiped down with Nolvasan and 70% ethanol. Mice were run on a declined plat- form (achieved by elevating the back end of the treadmill 8 inches off the ground) on day 1 of testing, rested for 4 days, then run on a flat platform. Muscle strength was tested using a Grip Strength Meter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH); all limbs, then forelimbs only were tested.
\n
\nTissue Collection. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100mg/kg/10mg/kg), and blood was collected from the heart into heparinized tubes using the cardiac puncture tech- nique. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes, and plasma samples were immediately snap frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Following blood removal, animals were sacrificed via cervical dislocation, and the brain was dissected out of the skull, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs were removed, and the remaining tissue was bisected along the midline. Half the brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in a circulating water bath for 1 h, 150 W, at 30°C using a BioWave (Pelco, Ted Pella, Inc, Redding, CA) microwave fixation system, then postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. The other half of the brain was homoge- nized in Syn-PER Synaptic Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher), and synaptosome and cytosolic components were isolated according to the manufacturers protocol. Fixed brain tissue was mounted on a Leica VT1000 S Vibratome and sagittally sectioned into 50 μm slices, which were then stored in PBS/0.05% sodium azide at 4°C.
\n
\n## LC-MS/MS Analysis
\n
\nLC-MS/MS analysis was based on a previously validated method for quantitation of curcumin in plasma [16]. Experimental plasma samples and blank mouse plasma spiked with known amounts of curcumin were treated as follows, in triplicate. Frozen samples were thawed on ice, and 50 μL of sample was mixed with 150 μL acetonitrile containing 0.15 ng/μL honokiol inter- nal standard (Sigma). For enzyme treatment, curcumin spiked plasma standards and experi- mental plasma samples (50 μL) were incubated with 5 μL B-glucuronidase (20 units, Type H-2, Sigma G0876) at 37°C for 1 hour. Precipitated protein was separated by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 5 minutes. The remaining supernatant was filtered through 0.22 μ Millipore Dura- por PVDF spin filter, and 10 μL was injected onto a Zorbax Extend-C18 column (4.6x150mm, 5 μm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The mobile phase was a mixture of (A) water and (B) acetoni- trile, both containing 0.02% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min, and the following gra- dient was applied: 50–95% B over 0–5 min, 95% B for 3 min, followed by a return to 50% B and equilibration. For MS/MS analysis the Shimadzu Prominence HPLC was interfaced to an Ap- plied BioSystems 4000 Q-TRAP hybrid triple-quadrupole, linear ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray interface (ESI) used in negative ion mode, with the following source parame- ters: source voltage, -4.5 kV; source temperature, 500°C; Ion source gas 1, 20; ion source gas 2, 50l/h; curtain gas, 15; interface heater, on. Curcumin and honokiol were measured using multi- ple reaction monitoring (MRM) and optimal parameters were determined by direct infusion of each compound (Table 1). The collision gas was set to medium.
\n
\n## Immunohistochemistry
\n
\nHuman frontal cortex from a patient with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and a normal healthy control were obtained from the OHSU Brain Bank, and 50 μm sections were cut on a Leica VT1000 S Vibratome. To detect phosphorylated α-synuclein in both human and mouse tissue, brain sections were blocked in 0.1% Triton-X, 10% goat serum for 1–2 hours, then stained with rabbit monoclonal S129-P-α-synuclein antibody (Abcam, catalogue number ab51253, 1:1000 for mouse tissue, 1:500 for human tissue) overnight at 4°C, washed extensive- ly, then stained with goat anti-rabbit Alexa-647 (Invitrogen) at 1:2000 overnight at 4°C. Mouse brain tissue was mounted in CFMR2 (Citifluor, London, UK), which partially cleared the tissue to allow for deeper imaging depths, and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. IMARIS software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to quantify GFP and S129-P fluo- rescence at individual synapses, and the CoLoc function was used to analyze S129-P/GFP colo- calization. For curcumin or Thioflavin-S (ThS) co-staining in human brain tissue, sections were first stained with antibodies, then washed in 70% ethanol, incubated with 10 μM curcu- min or 0.05% ThS in 50% ethanol for 10–15 minutes, washed again in 70% ethanol, and rehy- drated in water. Tissue was mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with the spectral imaging with line- ar unmixing module. Spectral imaging was performed in lambda mode using a 9.7nm gradient width and 34 PMT detectors for a 419–691 nm wavelength range.
\n
\n## Proteinase-K and Western Blot analysis
\n
\nProteinase-K-resistant aggregates were analyzed by incubating synaptosome and cytosolic brain fractions with 10 μg/mL Proteinase-K (Thermo Scientific) for 30 minutes at 37°C, fol- lowed by SDS-PAGE western blot using the Li-cor Odyssey CLx quantitative western blot im- aging system. Syn-GFP blot signal was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (Abcam, 1:2000), and data was quantified using LiCor Image Studio software.
\n
\n## Cranial window surgery and in vivo imaging
\n
\nCranial window surgery, in vivo imaging and photobleaching experiments were performed as previously described [15]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2%) and a cranial window was surgically installed on the skull. Following surgery, animals were monitored for pain and given daily i.p. injections of buprenorphine for 1–3 days, as needed. Imaging experi- ments were begun at least 3 weeks following placement of the cranial window. For multiphoton imaging, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, mounted to a custom stereotaxic frame, and imaged using a 20x/1.0NA water immersion objection and a Zeiss LSM 7MP multiphoton microscope, outfitted with dual channel BiG (binary GaAsP) detectors and the Coherent Cha- meleon titanium-sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser source, tuned to 860 nm. Baseline images of Syn-GFP-labeled cell bodies and presynaptic terminals in cortical layers 2/3 were obtained using 1–3 mW power (measured at objective exit). Large square regions of interest (ROI, 53x53 μm2) encompassing 50–100 terminals were bleached with ~100–150 mW power over <10 ms, and recovery images were acquired at 1–5 minute intervals, for 15 minutes. Zeiss Zen 2011 image acquisition software was used for image acquisition, and data was analyzed using Fiji image analysis software (http://fiji.sc/). The background-subtracted fluorescence intensity of the ROI was calculated for each time point and graphed as normalized fluorescence intensity vs. time using Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The data was fit as a one-phase associ- ation to calculate the tau recovery rate and the immobile fraction.
\n
\n## Statistics
\n
\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using Prism software (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA), and all data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. For behavioral analysis, right and left paw data was averaged for the fore paws or hind paws for each animal, then data for each animal in a group were averaged, to yield an n = 4 animals per group. Unless otherwise noted, unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were used to determine significance between groups. Since no significant dif- ferences were detected between male and female mice, results from both sexes were combined.
\n
\n## Results
\n
\nCurcumin binds to Lewy Bodies in diseased human brain tissue
\nTo eliminate confounding effects due to variations in purification methods or the presence of other curcuminoids, we used synthetic curcumin, as opposed to turmeric root or extracted cur- cumin. We found that curcumin from Chromadex was >99% pure by HPLC, stable in 100% DMSO solution over 1 week, and stable as a powder for over 1 year.
\n
\nWe next characterized the ability of curcumin to bind to LBs in diseased human brain tissue. Previous data has shown that curcumin labels human A-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tan- gles, suggesting a specific preference for proteins in a beta-sheet rich amyloid confirmation, similar to dyes such as Thioflavin-S/T and Congo Red [5,17,18]. Because human brain tissue contains significant amounts of lipofuscin autofluorescence, which overlaps with the broad curcumin emission spectrum, we found that spectral imaging combined with linear unmixing was useful to accurately detect curcumin staining above the autofluorescent background in the tissue. Using a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope with spectral unmixing capabili- ties, we were able to isolate two autofluorescent spectra, as well as separate spectra for curcu- min and Alexa-647 secondary antibodies, with minimal unassigned residual light (Fig 1A). This technique resulted in clear separation of each fluorescent component, particularly the autofluorescence-2 channel and curcumin, which have closely overlapping spectra that are dif- ficult to tease apart using regularly available emission filters [5]. Using this technique, we found that curcumin binds to Serine-129-phosphorylated (S129-P)-α-synuclein-positive corti- cal LBs in human brain tissue from patients with DLB (Fig 1B–1G). While it appeared as though the LBs may contain a smaller central core of S129-P-α-synuclein, with a larger region of curcumin staining outside this core, we believe that this is likely a result of the software at- tempting to clearly assign only one spectral component to the LB core. In normal control brain tissue, no staining for S129-P-α-synuclein was seen (S1 Fig). To our knowledge, this is the first report of curcumin binding to LBs in human brain tissue.
\n
\n## Free and glucuronidated curcumin are present in plasma from mice on a curcumin diet
\n
\nGiven this data that curcumin can bind to, and therefore potentially modulate, aggregated α- synuclein in human tissue, we next set out to test its effects in synucleinopathy mouse models. To examine the long-term effects of curcumin, we treated Syn-GFP mice with 500 ppm curcu- min diet or control diet for 6 months. Food consumption and body weight were monitored weekly; no significant differences between curcumin and control diet mice were found at any time point (Fig 2A and 2B). Motor behavior was assessed at 23 weeks, and brain tissue and plasma was harvested at 24 weeks.
\n
\nWe used a previously validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC– MS/MS) method to measure curcumin levels in plasma samples after dietary treatment [16]. In both spiked control plasma matrix and experimental samples, we detected a single peak corre- sponding to curcumin (molecular weight 368) by following the 367/133 and 367/217 MRM transitions (Fig 2C). The 367/133 transition values were used for quantification of curcumin. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was calculated as 5 ng/mL due to this being the lowest value on the standard curve, although curcumin peaks were clearly detectable with signal to noise ratios greater than 10:1 at lower concentrations, and the lower limit of detection (LLOD) was 0.033 ng/mL. Standard curves were linear in the range of 0–500 ng/mL curcumin
\n(r = 0.998±0.002). We found an average plasma curcumin concentration of < 5 ng/mL (4.40± 5.72 ng/mL) in 3 out of 4 mice on a curcumin diet (Table 2). One sample did not contain de- tectable curcumin, likely because of rapid metabolism of free curcumin (see below) and a de- layed period of time between the last food consumption time point (at the end of the dark cycle in the early morning) and sacrifice (early afternoon). We did not detect curcumin in plasma from control diet mice.
\n
\nCurcumin is rapidly metabolized in vivo through two pathways—reduction of the com- pound to dihydrocurcumin, tetrahydro-curcumin, and hexahydrocurcumin, and addition of a sugar group to yield curcumin-glucuronide versions of the parent compound and each of the three metabolites. Previous research has shown that up to 99% of curcumin is rapidly glucuro- nidated in vivo [19]. To examine the levels of curcumin-glucuronide in mice on a curcumin diet, we treated plasma samples with B-glucuronidase prior to LC-MS/MS, to remove the sugar and reduce the compound back to free curcumin. After enzyme treatment, we found an average curcumin concentration of 12.52±10.68 ng/mL, indicating that 94.1±7.3% of curcumin was glucuronidated in plasma from curcumin diet mice (Table 2). Enzyme treatment did allow us to detect curcumin in the mouse sample that had no free curcumin (mouse #183), indicating that 100% of the curcumin in this mouse was glucuronidated. Surprisingly, mouse #164 had a lower concentration of curcumin in plasma after enzyme treatment, perhaps indicating that the curcumin in this sample had degraded during freeze/thaw cycles between the initial mass spec run and the enzyme treatment experiment.
\n
\n## Curcumin diet intervention improves motor behavior
\n
\nAutomated gait analysis is a highly sensitive tool for measuring changes in multiple gait param- eters in mouse models of PD, Huntington’s Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [20]. To examine the effects of curcumin intervention on motor behavior, we tested curcumin and control diet mice using automated gait analysis on the DigiGait machine, and measured changes in several parameters. On a declined platform, there was a significant increase in hind paw angle in curcumin diet mice (5.0±2.5 degrees for control diet, 14.1±5.6 degrees for curcu- min diet, p<0.05). On a flat platform, mice on a curcumin diet showed a significant increase in fore paw swing duration (87.7±0.3 ms for control diet, 101.3±5.1 ms for curcumin diet, p<0.01; Fig 3A) and a non-significant trend towards a decrease in hind paw stride frequency (3.9±0.1 steps/sec for control diet, 3.6±0.2 steps/sec for curcumin diet, p = 0.0671), compared to control diet mice. Combined, these two parameters indicate that control diet mice took a greater number of shorter steps in a given time period, which is consistent with gait changes re- ported in a toxin-induced mouse model of PD [21]. These altered gait dynamics in our mouse model are due to expression of the Syn-GFP transgene, and curcumin diet intervention was able to partially normalize this deficit.
\nStrikingly, the ataxia coefficient, an index of step-to-step variability that is increased in human PD patients, was significantly decreased in the fore paws for curcumin diet mice com- pared to control (0.55±0.10 for control diet, 0.32±0.05 for curcumin diet, p<0.01; Fig 3B). Two other PD-associated parameters, the variability in stride length and stance width in the fore paws, were also decreased in curcumin diet mice (stride length variability = 15.76±2.72% for control diet, 10.18±1.74% for curcumin diet, p<0.05; stance width variability = 27.55±3.85% for control diet, 12.95±5.05% for curcumin diet, p<0.01; Fig 3C and 3D). Stride length variabil- ity is higher in patients with PD [22,23]. In mice, the normal range is 10–12% and is increased in a toxin-induced mouse model of PD [21]. Increased stance width variability is associated with PD in human patients, and is normally in the range of 10–15% in mice [21,24]. While control diet mice fall outside of the normal range for both of these parameters, curcumin diet intervention normalized the effect of over-expressing the Syn-GFP transgene to return these mice to the normal range.
\n
\nWe also tested muscle strength in curcumin and control diet mice, using a Grip Strength Meter, and found no significant difference between groups (control diet = 2.65±0.31 Newtons, curcumin diet = 2.62±0.29 Newtons; p = 0.8723). This result is consistent with a separate study that showed no change in grip strength in a Pink1 genetic model of PD [25]. This supports the idea that the motor phenotype we detect is similar to PD-like phenotypes, and is not a result of changes in muscle strength.
\n
\nCurcumin diet intervention results in an increase in phosphorylated α- synuclein
\nWe next examined molecular changes in α-synuclein as a result of curcumin diet intervention, using immunohistochemical and biochemical assays on fixed and fresh brain tissue. We previ- ously found that presynaptic Syn-GFP terminal microaggregates contain S129-P forms of α- synuclein, and are resistant to digestion by Proteinase-K [15]. Here we find that staining for S129-P-α-synuclein was increased in presynaptic terminals in mice that were on a curcumin diet (Fig 4A and 4B). We found that there was no change in GFP fluorescence in presynaptic termi- nals, but there was an increase in the number, area, volume, and fluorescence of presynaptic S129-P puncta (control diet GFP fluorescence = 5373±1039 AU, curcumin diet GFP fluores- cence = 5171±955 AU, p = 0.3767; control diet S129-P fluorescence = 13641±1006 AU, curcumin diet S129-P fluorescence = 15170±1471 AU, p<0.0001; control diet S129-P number = 454±186, curcumin diet S129-P number = 604±146; p<0.0005; control diet S129-P area = 0.9±0.1 μm2, curcumin diet S129-P area = 1.1±0.1 μm2, p<0.0001; control diet S129-P volume = 0.052± 0.009 μm3, curcumin diet S129-P volume = 0.066±0.011 μm3, p<0.0001; Fig 4C). When we looked exclusively at Syn-GFP-positive terminals, we also detected a significant increase in S129-P levels, as measured by analyzing the amount of colocalization between S129-P and Syn- GFP (control diet Pearson’s coefficient = 0.16±0.06, curcumin diet Pearson’s coefficient = 0.23± 0.5, p<0.01, Fig 4D and 4E). Combined, these IHC findings indicate that chronic exposure to curcumin results in a global increase in α-synuclein phosphorylation state, at both synapses that contain endogenous mouse α-synuclein and synapses that over-express the human Syn-GFP protein. We also found a strong correlation between plasma levels of curcumin and S129-P fluo- rescence intensity, in individual mice (Fig 4F).
\nTo biochemically examine aggregates, we isolated synaptosome and cytosolic proteins from whole brain extracts of mice that were on a curcumin or control diet. Our previous work dem- onstrated that Syn-GFP mice contain a single species of Syn-GFP, identified by molecular weight under denaturing SDS-PAGE western blot conditions, and do not contain multiple SDS-resistant aggregate species of different molecular weights [15]. We further found that ~35% of Syn-GFP in synaptosomes is resistant to digestion by Proteinase-K, compared to ~2% of cytosolic Syn-GFP [15]. In curcumin diet mice, we did not detect any significant changes in the Syn-GFP Proteinase-K-resistant fraction in synaptosomes or cytosolic compartments, indi- cating that chronic curcumin treatment has no effect on Proteinase-K-resistant aggregates in these mice (control diet synaptosome fraction = 0.30±0.14, curcumin diet synaptosomes frac- tion = 0.40±0.09, p = 0.2654; control diet cytosolic fraction = 0.03±0.02, curcumin diet cytosol- ic fraction = 0.03±0.03, p = 0.9762; Fig 5).
\n
\n## Acute curcumin treatment modulates phosphorylation of α-synuclein, but has no effect on in vivo aggregation
\n
\nTo look more directly at the effect of curcumin on terminal microaggregates in vivo, we adopted an acute curcumin treatment paradigm that we could apply to Syn-GFP mice that had surgically-installed cranial windows over the cortex. We have shown previously that Syn-GFP terminal microaggregates have slower recovery kinetics and a significant immobile fraction in Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, compared to soluble Syn- GFP in the cell body [15]. We treated mice with 15 mg/kg/day curcumin or DMSO vehicle con- trol i.p. for 15 days, and examined FRAP kinetics at pre-injection, 7 day, and 14 day time points. We found no significant change in the immobile fraction (IF) or the tau recovery rate due to curcumin treatment (pretreatment DMSO IF = 0.52±0.11, 1 week DMSO IF = 0.53± 0.10, 2 week DMSO IF = 0.48±0.11, pretreatment curcumin IF = 0.49±0.15, 1 week curcumin IF = 0.48±0.14, 2 week curcumin IF = 0.36±0.16; pretreatment DMSO tau = 3.00±1.66 ms, 1 week DMSO tau = 3.66±2.17 ms, 2 week DMSO tau = 3.90±2.38 ms, pretreatment curcumin tau = 2.83±1.16 ms, 1 week curcumin tau = 2.58±0.96 ms, 2 week curcumin tau = 2.56±5.68 ms; Fig 6). A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there no effect of time or treat- ment, and no interaction effect (interaction p = 0.6927, time p = 0.1846, treatment p = 0.1471), although there was a trend towards a decrease in the immobile fraction over time in some cur- cumin regions analyzed.
\n
\nIn agreement with the in vivo FRAP data, we also found no significant change in the Pro- teinase-K-resistant fraction in fresh brain tissue from acutely-treated mice (S2 Fig). Similar to chronic curcumin treatment, we detected an increase in S129-P-α-synuclein in cortical synapses in acutely-treated curcumin mice, compared to DMSO treated controls (DMSO GFP fluorescence = 7659±2327 AU, curcumin GFP fluorescence = 8185±1483 AU, p = 0.4065; DMSO S129-P fluorescence = 12419±690 AU, curcumin S129-P fluorescence = 14931±3302 AU, p<0.001; DMSO S129-P number = 447±143, curcumin S129-P number = 523±238; p = 0.2023; DMSO S129-P area = 0.9±0.1 μm2, curcumin S129-P area = 1.1±0.2 μm2, p<0.01; DMSO S129-P volume = 0.050±0.013 μm3, curcumin S129-P volume = 0.066±0.025 μm3, p<0.05; Fig 7A–7C). However, when we looked specifically at Syn-GFP-positive synapses, we detected a significant decrease in S129-P levels after 2 weeks of curcumin treatment, as indicated by a smaller Pearson’s colocalization coefficient between GFP and S129-P (DMSO Pearson’s coefficient = 0.19±0.07, curcumin Pearson’s coefficient = 0.11±0.05, p<0.001; Fig 7D and 7E).
\n
\nFinally, we detected an average of 11.55±2.51 ng/mL free curcumin in plasma from 15-day curcumin treated mice, which were sacrificed 5 hours after the last curcumin treatment
\n(Table 2). Following B-glucuronidase treatment of plasma, we detected an average of 372.89± 104.24 ng/mL curcumin, indicating that 96.6±1.5% of curcumin in the blood is glucuronidated 5 hours after i.p. injection (Table 2). Unlike chronic curcumin treatment, there was no correla- tion between plasma levels of curcumin and S129-P fluorescence intensity, in individual mice that received acute curcumin treatment (Fig 7F).
\n
\n## Discussion
\n
\nWe have found that transgenic α-synuclein mice show improvements in gait after chronic treatment with a moderate dose of dietary curcumin. For a 500 ppm curcumin diet, daily con- sumption rates of ~ 4 g of food would result in 2 mg of curcumin consumed per day over a 6 month period. Despite well-established problems of low bioavailability [16,26], many of curcu- min’s cellular mechanisms of action occur in the nM to μM range. Indeed, 0.1–1.0 μM concen- trations of curcumin can protect against α-synuclein-induced cell death in tissue culture cells, and curcumin was shown to disaggregate α-synuclein aggregates in vitro at concentrations of 0.5–5.0 μM [10,12]. Here we extend these in vitro findings to show, for the first time in a genet- ic synucleinopathy mouse model, that a moderate dose of dietary curcumin is sufficient to im- prove motor phenotype.
\n
\nUsing LC-MS/MS, we measured mean values of ~4.5 ng/mL free curcumin (range 0–11 ng/mL) and ~12.5 ng/mL total curcumin (range 2–27 ng/mL; free and glucuronidated) in plas- ma from curcumin diet mice. However, these values are probably lower than peak plasma levels actually attained. Plasma was collected in the early afternoon, leaving at least 6 hours between the end of the dark cycle and thus, likely the last significant food consumption time point. Be- cause the half-life of oral curcumin in mouse plasma is 3.5 hours [19], it is likely that curcumin plasma levels significantly declined due to the lag in collection time. The lag between the last feeding and collection may also contribute to some of the variability between samples. A previ- ous group reported 35 ng/mL curcumin in plasma from mice on a 500 ppm diet for 4 months [3], but these authors did not report timing of the plasma collection relative to the dark cycle or last feeding time point. With acute curcumin dosing, we detected mean values of ~12 ng/mL free curcumin (range 9–13 ng/mL) and ~373 ng/mL total curcumin (range 273–481 ng/mL; free and glucuronidated) in plasma from mice that were treated with 15 mg/kg/day (450 μg) i.p. curcumin for 15 days, and sacrificed 5 hours after the last curcumin treatment. This is also lower than previous reports, which found 127 ng/mL curcumin in plasma 4 hours after 140 μg was injected i.p. into an AD mouse model [3]. These differences could be due to variable me- tabolism in the different mouse strains used.
\n
\nIn this study, in order to measure curcumin’s molecular effects on α-synuclein, half of each mouse brain was fixed for IHC and the other half processed for synaptosome isolation and sub- sequent biochemistry; therefore, there was insufficient tissue to attempt to measure brain curcumin levels by LC-MS/MS. Curcumin does cross the blood-brain barrier [3,19], and Begum et al. found 0.47 μg/g (1.28 μM) and 0.74 μg/g (2.01 μM) in mouse brain tissue follow- ing chronic dietary and i.p. delivery methods, respectively. These authors showed that with 4 months of chronic dosing with a curcumin diet identical to ours (500 ppm curcumin diet), cur- cumin was highly enriched in mouse brain tissue, with a brain-to-plasma ratio of 13.4 [3]. With acute dosing, using an i.p. dose of curcumin that is half of the dosage used in our study, they found a brain-to-plasma ratio of 5.85, 4 hours after treatment [3]. These results highlight that curcumin, a lipophilic compound, is more stable in brain than in plasma, and can reach concentrations that are within the range of what has been shown to affect α-synuclein cellular function in vitro (see above). Interestingly, we found a strong positive correlation between in- creased levels of S129-P at individual cortical terminals and plasma levels of curcumin, in indi- vidual mice that were on a curcumin diet (Fig 4). This underscores the accumulation and stability of curcumin in lipid-rich brain tissue, particularly with chronic treatment, and lends further support to the brain-specific effects of dietary curcumin in our system. Because curcu- min is intrinsically auto-fluorescent, we also attempted to directly measure global curcumin fluorescence or curcumin localization to individual presynaptic terminals using in vivo cranial window imaging, but did not detect any significant changes in fluorescence at either 1–3 hours or 7–14 days after acute curcumin treatment.
\nThe Syn-GFP mouse mimics human duplication and triplication mutations to model cellu- lar changes that occur due to 2-3-fold over-expression of α-synuclein. The presence of α-synu- clein microaggregates in presynaptic terminals, but not cell bodies, makes this mouse an excellent in vivo model of early cellular aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which occurs in many diseases including PD, DLB, and related synucleinopathies [15]. Syn-GFP mice do not show extensive neurodegeneration, severe motor decline, or early mortality rates, compared to more severe mouse models which more strongly overexpress α-synuclein bearing point mutations [14]. Despite this mild phenotype, we were able to measure significant changes in motor behav- ior due to curcumin diet intervention. Of these gait changes, 3 parameters that are associated with PD-like symptoms were found to be abnormally elevated in control diet mice, and 6 months of curcumin diet intervention was sufficient to bring these parameters back into the normal range. In control diet mice, expression of Syn-GFP increased the variability in both stride length and stance width, which are the same gait parameters reported to increase in a toxin-induced mouse model of PD [21]. It would be interesting to examine curcumin diet in- tervention in the A53T and E46K α-synuclein point mutation mouse models that show more severe motor dysfunction and early mortality [27,28], at varying time points of disease progres- sion, to test whether curcumin treatment could halt or reverse these more severe neurodegen- erative phenotypes.

\nWe measured a global increase in S129-P-α-synuclein in cortical presynaptic terminals in mice that were chronically and acutely treated with curcumin. With chronic curcumin treat- ment, this increase in phosphorylation was also present at Syn-GFP-positive terminals, while in acutely-treated mice we measured a decrease in S129-P at Syn-GFP-positive terminals. Combined, these data indicate that the effects of curcumin on phosphorylation of human Syn- GFP are differentially modulated over acute and chronic treatment time points, despite there being an overall increase in endogenous mouse S129-P for both acute and chronic curcumin exposure. With acute treatment, where S129-P-α-synuclein is decreased in terminals contain- ing human Syn-GFP but increased in terminals containing endogenous mouse α-synuclein, this could represent an effect of short-term curcumin treatment specifically on human α-synu- clein that is reversed with long-term exposure to curcumin. Human and mouse α-synuclein differ by only 7 amino acids and may functionally compensate for each other, but importantly, endogenous mouse protein contains a threonine at the 53 position that is associated with increased aggregation and toxicity in human patients [9]. It has been proposed that curcumin binds to amino acids 89–91 of α-synuclein [13]; thus if threonine-53 present in mouse protein is responsible for the differential effects of curcumin, it may occur through allosteric changes to the binding pocket. It is also possible that curcumin acts to increase mouse α-synuclein presyn- aptic terminal expression, which could result in an overall increase in S129-P staining. We did not measure mouse α-synuclein by IHC due to the relative lack of a high quality mouse-specific antibody, but we did find that there was no change in human Syn-GFP levels with acute or chronic treatment. It will also be interesting in future studies to determine which kinases and phosphatases are involved in modifying the presynaptic pool of α-synuclein at S129, and to de- termine if curcumin may be directly modulating activity of these enzymes to produce the changes that we have measured.
\nHow S129-P phosphorylation of α-synuclein affects aggregation and toxicity is currently under debate. Because S129-P-α-synuclein is highly correlated with disease progression and pathology, with up to 90% of α-synuclein in LBs containing this modification, S129-P has long been thought to be a marker of toxic forms of the protein [29,30]. However, recent evidence in- dicates that S129-P modification targets the protein for degradation via the autophagy path- way, and phosphorylation at this site was found to be neuro-protective both in vitro and in vivo [31]. We found that mice on a curcumin diet showed improvements in motor behavior as well as a global increase in S129-P in cortical pre-synaptic terminals, which supports the hy- pothesis that S129-P is protective in our synucleinopathy mouse model. The decrease in S129-P at Syn-GFP synapses after 2 weeks of curcumin treatment did not correlate with any changes in Syn-GFP terminal microaggregates, as measured by in vivo FRAP experiments and Proteinase-K digestion, indicating that longer time points of treatment may be needed to mea- sure a direct effect of curcumin on α-synuclein aggregation.
\n
\nThere are a number of possible mechanisms for how curcumin treatment increases S129-P- α-synuclein and improves motor behavior. Curcumin has been shown to increase proteasome activity and heat shock protein expression at low doses (up to 1 μM) in vitro, and to induce autophagic clearance of A-beta, which resulted in attenuated cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model [32,33]. Degradation of α-synuclein can occur through both proteasome and autophagy pathways, and S129-P has been shown to directly target α-synuclein for autophagic degradation to provide neuroprotection and motor improvement in another mouse model of PD [31,34]. There is also evidence that phosphomimic of S129 inhibits binding of pore-form- ing α-synuclein oligomers to membranes, thus conferring protection by blocking this form of toxic oligomers [35]. Thus curcumin’s action to increase α-synuclein phosphorylation may specifically promote its degradation via autophagy or proteasomal pathways, or by blocking the membrane-binding activity of toxic oligomers. Another possible mechanism involves direct disaggregation of α-synuclein by curcumin binding. Curcumin can directly bind to and disag- gregate both α-synuclein oligomers and fibrils in vitro, but phosphorylation state of the protein was not examined in those experiments [12,13]. Furthermore, the Syn-GFP microaggregates that we have previously characterized in these mice are not higher-order oligomers or fibrils, but instead exist as smaller aggregate species that are easily disaggregated into a single Syn- GFP band by SDS-PAGE analysis, consistent with this mouse being a model for early stages in the aggregate cascade [15]. We found no evidence that acute or chronic curcumin treatment modulates Proteinase K resistance of microaggregates in our mice, however FRAP experiments were only performed on acute curcumin treated mice. To test for a possible direct interaction between curcumin and Syn-GFP aggregates, further biochemical experiments would be neces- sary to characterize these aggregates, possibly by native western blot analysis or sequential SDS/Triton/Urea extraction. It would also be beneficial to use aggregate-specific antibodies, or antibodies to other post-translational modifications, to examine how curcumin may be modulating these different aggregate forms. For example, there is evidence that α-synuclein ag- gregates undergo nitration-based oxidative damage [36]. Curcumin is known to be a potent anti-oxidant and may be modulating α-synuclein, and ultimately motor behavior, by decreas- ing reactive oxygen species [11]. While further studies are needed to better understand the mo- lecular mechanisms underlying chronic curcumin diet intervention in synucleinopathy mouse models, our data demonstrate improvements in motor behavior, providing strong support for curcumin therapy as the subject of further pre-clinical studies.

\n# Abstract
\nWe previously identified a stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA), which induces differentiation of neural cells, including midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) dopaminergic neurons, from mouse embryonic stem cells. We report here that SDIA induces efficient neural differentiation also in primate embryonic stem cells. Induced neurons contain TH+ neurons at a frequency of 35% and produce a significant amount of dopamine. Interestingly, differentiation of TH+ neurons from undifferentiated embryonic cells occurs much faster in vitro (10 days) than it does in the embryo (≈5 weeks). In addition, 8% of the colonies contain large patches of Pax6+-pigmented epithelium of the retina. The SDIA method provides an unlimited source of primate cells for the study of pathogenesis, drug development, and transplantation in degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and retinitis pigmentosa.
\nInitiation of vertebrate neural differentiation in the embryonic ectoderm is triggered by inductive signals emanating from axial mesoderm (1, 2). In Xenopus, neural inducers from Spemann's organizer such as Noggin and Chordin play a major role in this process (3, 4). The neural inducers bind to and inactivate bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which suppresses neural differentiation of ectodermal cells and promotes epidermal differentiation. In Drosophila, Sog (fly homologue of Chordin) is a positive regulator of the initiation of central nervous system formation and antagonizes the activity of Dpp (fly BMP homologue), suggesting a conserved role of BMP and anti-BMP signals in neural determination across species (5).
\nIn amphibians, suppression of BMP signaling is proven to be essential and sufficient for neural induction in ectodermal tissues. In mammals, by contrast, very few experimental data have been available regarding the mechanisms underlying early neural differentiation. Recent studies have shown that attenuation of BMP signaling is essential, but not sufficient, for neural differentiation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Addition of BMP4 suppresses neural differentiation of ES cells both in floating culture (embryoid body) (6) and in substrate-attached cell culture (7). However, blockade of BMP signals by adding soluble BMP receptor–Fc chimera proteins or by overexpressing Chordin does not significantly promote neural differentiation of mouse ES cells, suggesting that some additional signaling is required for mammalian neural induction (7).
\nWe previously described a strong neuralizing activity present on the cell surface of stromal cells and named it SDIA (stromal cell-derived inducing activity) (7). In the absence of exogenous BMP4, mouse ES cells efficiently differentiate into neural precursors and neurons [>90% cells become neural cell adhesion molecule-positive (NCAM+)] when cultured on SDIA-possessing mouse stromal cells (PA6 cells) for a week. The SDIA method has several advantages in production of neurons as compared with previous embryoid body methods (8, 9). First, the SDIA method is technically simple. ES cells are grown in a flat culture from single cells into colonies. Second, neural differentiation of ES cells is not only efficient but also speedy; the postmitotic neuron marker TuJ (class III β-tubulin) appears on day 4–5. Finally (and most importantly), SDIA-treated ES cells differentiate into midbrain dopaminergic neurons at a high frequency; 30% of neurons derived from mouse ES cells are dopaminergic and produce significant amounts of dopamine. These cells survive at a reasonable rate (≈20%) 2 weeks after implantation in mouse striatum and extend dopaminergic neurites into the target tissue (7).
\nConsidering the usefulness in medical research, we have recently established pluripotent embryonic stem cell lines from blastocysts of Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey), which is commonly used in preclinical studies (10). ES cells derived from primate (human and monkey) blastocysts possess a number of characteristics distinct from mouse cells, such as surface antigens, leukemia inhibitory factor-independency, and long doubling times (10–14). In this study, we have tested the SDIA method with primate ES cells and investigated its potential application for producing medically useful cells.
\n
\n# Materials and Methods
\nMaintenance of Primate ES Cells. Cynomolgus monkey ES cell lines were established, and their pluripotency was confirmed by teratoma formation in severe combined immunodeficiency mice as described previously (10). Undifferentiated ES cells were maintained on a feeder layer of mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor/20% knockout serum replacement (GIBCO)/4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. Subculturing of ES cells was performed by using 0.25% trypsin in PBS with 20% knockout serum replacement and 1 mM CaCl2 as described (10).
\n
\nInduction of Neural Differentiation of Primate ES Cells. PA6 cells were plated on type I collagen-coated chamber slides (Falcon) or gelatin-coated dishes and used as a feeder cell layer (7, 15). To strictly avoid contamination by incidentally differentiating cells, we manually selected undifferentiated ES cell colonies with stem cell-like morphology (tightly packed cells with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio; see Fig. 1A). Undifferentiated ES cell colonies were first washed twice with GMEM medium supplemented with 10% knockout serum replacement/1 mM pyruvate/0.1 mM nonessential amino acids/0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (differentiation medium). After trypsinization for 5 min at 37°C, partially dissociated ES cell clumps (10–50 cells/one clump) were plated on PA6 cells at a density of 500 clumps/10-cm dish and cultured in the differentiation medium for 3 weeks or indicated periods. Medium was changed every third day. Unlike mouse ES cells, monkey ES cells do not form colonies from single cells on PA6 cells. Low cloning efficiency has been also reported for human ES cells (12–14). It is therefore necessary to plate clumps of 10–50 undifferentiated ES cells for starting induction. Two independent ES cell lines (CMK 6 and 9; normal karyotypes) were used and found to give similar results. In some experiments, 0.5 nM BMP4 (R & D Systems) was added to the differentiation medium on day 0 and at each medium change.

\n### Immunostaining
\nThe antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (NCAM/polyclonal/used in a dilution of 1:300, TH/polyclonal/1:100, NeuN/monoclonal/1:100, ChAT/polyclonal/1:20, peripherin/polyclonal/1:100, and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)/polyclonal/1:200), Diasorin (serotonin/polyclonal/1:1,000), DSHB (Islet-1/monoclonal/1:200, and SSEA-4/monoclonal/1:50), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (GAD/polyclonal/1:10), Babco (Richmond, CA) (TuJ1/polyclonal/1:600 and Pax6/polyclonal/1:500), and Medac (Wedel, Germany) (CCK-8/polyclonal/1:100). The specificity of these antibodies was tested by using appropriate tissues or cells as positive controls. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with primary antibodies. Localization of antigens was visualized by using secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC, Cy3, or horseradish peroxidase. FITC-phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes.
\nPositive colonies were defined as colonies containing positive cells regardless of population. To estimate the efficacy of the differentiation at the cell level, colonies were randomly selected, and the numbers of positive cells were counted after a 3-week differentiation period. The numbers of total cells were examined by using DAPI, YOYO-1 (Molecular Probe), or anti-human nuclei antibody (Chemicon; also recognizing monkey nuclei). When necessary, data are given as mean ± standard deviation obtained from at least three independent experiments.
\n
\n### Detection of Dopamine.
\nMonkey ES cells were cultured on a PA6 cell layer for 3 weeks and were incubated for 15 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution (3 ml/10-cm dish) containing 56 mM KCl to induce depolarization of neurons. Then, the media were stabilized with 0.1 mM EDTA and analyzed for dopamine by using HPLC with fluorescence detection as described previously (16). Results were validated by coelution with authentic substances.
\nRNA Analysis. Reverse transcriptase–PCR was performed as described previously (4). The primers used are as follows: Lmx1b, GCAGCGGCTGCATGGAGAAGATCGC and GGTTCTGAAACCAGACCTGGACCAC; Nurr1, CTCCCAGAGGGAACTGCACTTCG and CTCTGGAGTTAAGAAATCGGAGCTG; Nrp-1/Musashi1, CGAGCTCGACTCCAAAACAATTGACC and TCTACACGGAATTCGGGGAACTGGTA; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG and GGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGACTC. PCR products using these primers were confirmed by sequencing.
\n
\n###Culture of Pigmented Epithelium.
\nAfter monkey ES cells were cultured on a PA6 cell layer for 3 weeks, a patch of pigmented cells was mechanically isolated by using a 200-μl tip and plated on a fresh PA6 cell layer in differentiation medium or on a collagen I-coated dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. The pigmented cells grew reasonably fast in both cases and could be replated at least twice.
\n
\n###Sorting Neural Cells.
\nThe cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37°C, filtered with nylon mesh, spun down, and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA. After incubation with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD56 antibody (NKH-1, Beckman Coulter) for 20 min at 4°C, positive cells were sorted with FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Sorted cells were cultured on a laminine/poly-L-ornithine-coated dish and were immunostained with neural- and neuron-specific antibodies such as anti-NCAM (cytoplasmic domain) and TuJ, respectively.
\n
\n###Transplantation Experiment.
\nFor 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment, 6-week-old severe combined immunodeficiency mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and fixed on a stereotactic device (Narishige, Tokyo); 6-OHDA (8 mg/ml) was injected unilaterally with a glass needle at three sites into the striatum as described previously (7). SDIA-treated ES cells were implanted into the ipsilateral striatum 7 days after 6-OHDA injection. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. ES cells were cultured on PA6 cells for 3 weeks in differentiation medium. Differentiated ES colonies were detached en bloc from feeder cells by treatment with collagenase B (1 mg/ml) and DNase I (25 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. Clumps of differentiated ES cells were labeled with 5 μg/ml CM-DiI in PBS supplemented with 4 mg/ml glucose for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed twice with GMEM, and then suspended in GMEM. By using a blunt-ended 26G Hamilton syringe, 9 × 104 cells (containing 1 × 104 TH+neurons) were slowly injected into the striatum (A + 0.9, L + 2.0, V + 3.0) over a 3-min period. In controls, suspension medium was injected. Two weeks after the transplantation, recipients were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.

\n# Results and Discussion
\n### Induction of Neural Differentiation in Primate ES Cells on PA6 Cells.
\nThe monkey ES cell lines CMK 6 and 9 (10) used in this work express high levels of undifferentiated state-specific markers such as alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-4 (ES colonies are shown by arrows in Fig. 1 A–C) but not the pan-neural marker NCAM (data not shown), even after maintenance in culture for more than 6 months.
\nWe applied the SDIA method to primate ES cells with minor modifications (see Materials and Methods). After culture on PA6 cells for 2 weeks, extensive neurites were found in a majority of primate ES cell colonies (97 ± 3%, n = 78), which contained a large number of cells positive for NCAM (neural precursors and neurons, Fig. 1D) and postmitotic neurons positive for class III β-tubulin (TuJ) and NeuN markers (Fig. 1E). At the cellular level, 45 ± 13% of the SDIA-treated primate cells (n = 420) were NCAM-positive neural cells, and 25 ± 6% (n = 660) were TuJ-positive postmitotic neurons. When primate ES cells were cultured on a gelatin-coated dish without PA6, less than 1% of cells became NCAM+ (n = 530). Our previous study with mouse ES cells has shown that SDIA treatment induces NCAM and TuJ in 92% and 53% of mouse cells, respectively (7, 15), indicating that the efficiency of neural differentiation in primate ES cells by SDIA is about half of that in mouse cells. One possible influence on this neural/non-neural ratio might be the qualitative difference of the non-neural cells. Non-neural cells in the SDIA-treated primate colonies were mostly fast-growing E-cadherin-negative mesenchymal cells, whereas those in the murine colonies were slower growing E-cadherin-positive epithelial cells (unpublished observations).
\nWe next examined inhibitors of neural differentiation in primate cells. Our previous study with mouse ES cells has shown that BMP and serum inhibit neural differentiation of mouse cells (7). Similarly, addition of BMP4 (0.5 nM) or FBS (5%) efficiently suppressed neuronal differentiation in primate cells (Fig. 1F), suggesting that primate and mouse ES cells respond to the same positive (SDIA) and negative (BMP and serum) factors in neural differentiation.
\n
\n### Induction of Dopaminergic Neurons from Primate ES Cells.
\nSDIA has been reported to induce TH+dopaminergic neurons efficiently from mouse ES cells (7, 15). We therefore tested whether similar findings could be obtained with primate cells. After 2 weeks of induction, 80 ± 12% of the colonies contained TH+ cells (n = 40; Fig. 2A). At the cellular level, 35 ± 6% of the TuJ+ postmitotic neurons were TH-positive (n = 560; Fig.2B). Next, the amount of dopamine released upon depolarization was analyzed by HPLC assay (Fig. 2C). The SDIA-treated ES cells released 1.0 pmol/107 cells in response to high K+ depolarizing stimuli, indicating that they contain a significant number of functional dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 2C Lower; authentic substances in Fig. 2C Upper). In addition to dopamine, norepinephrine was also detected at the level of 0.5 pmol/107 cells. Consistently, 81% of TH+ neurons (28% of total neurons) were DBH-negative (dopaminergic neurons) on day 18, whereas the rest were DBH-positive (norepinephrinergic/epinephrinergic neurons) (n = 200) (Fig. 2D). The dopaminergic neurons induced by SDIA were CCK-negative (positive in A10 neuron; ref. 17) and GAD-negative (positive in olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons; ref. 18) (Fig. 2D). We next asked whether these TH+ neurons have characteristics of central nervous system or peripheral nervous system neurons. SDIA-induced TH+ neurons were negative for peripherin, which is a specific marker for PNS neurons (19) (n = 200; Fig. 2E). Further, reverse transcriptase–PCR analyses (Fig. 2F) showed that SDIA-induced neurons expressed midbrain dopaminergic neuron markers, such as Nurr1 and Lmx1b (20), whereas neither undifferentiated ES cells nor feeder cells did.
\n
\nWe next implanted SDIA-treated primate ES cells into the mouse striatum by the stereotaxic method. The striatum is a target nucleus of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and contains dopaminergic fibers but not cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons. SDIA-treated primate ES cells containing 1 × 104 TH+ neurons were grafted into the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse striatum from which dopaminergic fibers were depleted by 6-OHDA treatment as described previously (7). Two weeks after implantation (Fig. 2G), 8.3 ± 3.2% of implanted TH+ neurons (arrows, cell bodies) survived and extended neurites (arrowheads) in the tissue. This value is roughly comparable to that in the previous mouse study (7). We are currently attempting implantation into the monkey brain to evaluate long-term survival of primate TH+ neurons.
\n
\n## Temporal Regulation of Primate Neural Differentiation.
\nThe time required for fetal development varies significantly among different mammalian species. The gestation period of mice is 20 days, whereas that of M. fascicularis is 160 days. This large difference in time (8-fold) resides mainly in the lengths of the organogenetic and the fetal periods rather than in the early embryonic period.
\nWe therefore examined temporal regulation of neuronal makers during SDIA-induced neural differentiation in primate and mouse ES cells. The neural precursor marker Nrp-1/Musashi1 (21) was detected on day 4 and onward both in primate and mouse cells by reverse transcriptase–PCR analyses (data not shown). Next, temporal expression profiles of NCAM (pan-neural) and TuJ (neuronal) markers were analyzed by immunostaining as shown in Fig. 3 A and B, respectively (closed, primate cells; open, mouse cells). The expression of NCAM and TuJ took 1–3 days and 3–5 days longer in primate cells than in murine cells. TH+cells (Fig. 3C) first appeared on day 10 in the primate colonies, whereas the onset of TH+ cell generation in the murine colonies was between days 5–7.
\n
\nThe genesis of midbrain TH+ neurons occurs during the organogenetic period. TH+ neurons first appear in the murine midbrain on E10.5–11.5 (22, 23). In mice, the number of days required for dopaminergic neuron differentiation by SDIA in vitro (7 days) is roughly the same as that for in vivo genesis of TH+ neurons from the inner cell mass (7–8 days) (ref. 7 and Fig. 3C). In Macaca, TH+ neurons are reported to first appear about 5 weeks after implantation (24). By contrast, in vitro induction of TH+ neurons from primate ES cells by SDIA took only 10–12 days (Fig. 3C), showing that primate TH+ neurons differentiate from undifferentiated embryonic cells much faster in vitro than in vivo. One explanation might be that the speed of cell differentiation is actively reduced in primate embryos to allow sufficient numbers of precursor cells to accumulate for construction of the large primate brain. Regardless of the reason, in practice, the SDIA-based approach carries the advantage of requiring less time to produce dopaminergic neurons than had been expected from the in vivo time course.
\n
\n## Other Neuronal Markers Induced in SDIA-Treated Primate ES Cells.
\nWe next examined characteristics of TH-negative neurons induced by SDIA with various markers (Fig. 4). In addition to TH+neurons, the SDIA-treated primate ES cells gave rise to GAD-positive (GABAergic; 20 ± 8% of postmitotic neurons), ChAT-positive (cholinergic; 5 ± 3%), and 5HT-positive (serotonergic; 1 ± 0.5%) neurons (n = 300). The proportion of transmitter profiles is similar to that found with SDIA-treated mouse ES cells (7). Interestingly, neurons positive for Islet-1 (marker of motoneurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons) were found in primate cells (5 ± 3%, n = 160) and in mouse cells (10–15%; K.M., H.K., and Y.S., unpublished results).
\n
\n## Generation of Pigmented Epithelial Cells from Primate ES Cells.
\nOne unexpected finding from the primate study was the appearance of epithelial cells with massive pigmentation, which was rarely observed in SDIA-treated mouse ES cells or in primate ES cells cultured on the collagen-coated dish (unpublished observations). After culture on PA6 cells for 3 weeks, large patches of pigmented cells were present in 8 ± 4% of the primate ES cell colonies (n = 200; Fig. 5A) and grew at a constant rate on the feeder cells. The polygonal morphology with a compact cell–cell arrangement (Fig. 5B) was reminiscent of the pigmented epithelium of the eye (25) and clearly distinct from pigmented melanocytes derived from neural crest (26). Further, phalloidin staining showed polygonal “actin bundles” typical for pigmented epithelium (Fig. 5C) (27), rather than the “stress fiber” actin staining found in neural crest-derived pigment cells (28). From an ontogenic view, the pigmented epithelium of the eye is a derivative of the diencephalon and has the same origin (optic cup) as the neural retina. Consistently, pigmented epithelial cells from primate ES cells were positive for the optic cup marker Pax6 (reviewed in ref. 29) (Fig. 5D). These cells could be easily isolated manually under a dissecting microscope with a pipetman tip and expanded to confluency on PA6 cells as a feeder layer or on a collagen-coated dish without feeder cells (Fig. 5E; see Materials and Methods).
\nThe pigmented epithelium of the eye is a target tissue of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Therefore, the availability of primate pigmented epithelia generated in vitro should facilitate the pathogenetic and therapeutic studies of this retinal degenerative disease (30, 31). Also, because pigmented epithelia are derived from the optic cup, the SDIA method with modifications offers the potential to generate neural retinal cells such as photoreceptor cells in the future.
\n
\n## Application of Dopaminergic Neurons Derived from Primate ES Cells.
\nIn this report, we have shown that primate cells are successfully coaxed to differentiate into neural cells by the SDIA method. Although the percentage of neural cells in primate cell colonies is about half of that in mouse ones (45% vs. 92% as discussed above), this may be partially compensated by selective sorting. Using single-step FACS purification with the neural-specific surface antigen CD56 as a selection marker, SDIA–induced neural cells can be enriched by ≈2-fold, i.e., to the purity of 90% NCAM+ and 54% TuJ+ (unpublished data; see Materials and Methods). Also, neural precursor cells may be enriched by using a combination of other surface-sorting markers shown in recent studies, such as CD133+, CD45−, CD34−, CD24low, and PNAlow (32, 33).
\nThe ability to produce primate dopaminergic neurons by this simple in vitro preparation should greatly facilitate research in numerous areas of Parkinson's disease therapeutics (34–36). For instance, monkey dopaminergic neurons provide good in vitro systems for drug screening concerning the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons and for toxicity testing of substances potentially harmful to dopaminergic neurons, such as rotenone (37). This approach can be modified to a semi in vivo system by grafting these neurons into the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse brain. Also, primate dopaminergic neurons prepared by this method can be used to raise monoclonal antibodies against dopaminergic neuron-specific surface antigens for sorting.
\nOur present and previous (7) works have demonstrated that SDIA can induce dopaminergic neuron differentiation from murine and non-human primate ES cells. Considering the close phylogenetic relationship between humans and Macaca (both belong to the family of Catarrhini, the suborder of Anthropoidea), it is expected that the SDIA method should be applicable to the generation of dopaminergic neurons also from human ES cells. Over the last decade, a number of clinical efforts have been made for neuronal transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease (38). Grafting fetal midbrain tissues into the striatum significantly improves motor disorders in a substantial number of cases. The bottleneck of this therapeutic strategy has been the supply of neurons along with the accompanying ethical issues. The SDIA-based approach offers a practical alternative to brain tissues from aborted fetuses. As a first step toward this goal, we are planning to perform therapeutic studies by implanting primate dopaminergic neurons generated by SDIA into the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkey brain. At the level of efficacy shown in the present work (where dopaminergic neurons occupy 28% of postmitotic neurons, which are 25% of total cells), ≈5 × 107 total cells are necessary to successfully implant 3 × 105 dopaminergic cells (an expected therapeutic dose for neural grafting) (38), given that the survival rate after grafting is 8%. This indicates that only a dozen culture dishes are needed for one transplantation, demonstrating the practical feasibility of this approach.
\nIn conclusion, the SDIA method is a promising approach that brings stem cell therapy for Parkinson's disease toward the practical level.

\n### Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are associated with abnormal neuronal aggregation of  -synuclein. However, the mechanisms of aggregation and their relationship to disease are poorly understood. We developed an in vivo multiphoton imaging paradigm to study  -synuclein aggregation in mouse cortex with subcellular resolution. We used a green fluorescent protein-tagged human  -synuclein mouse line that has moderate overexpression levels mimicking human disease. Fluorescence recovery after photo- bleaching (FRAP) of labeled protein demonstrated that somatic  -synuclein existed primarily in an unbound, soluble pool. In contrast,  -synuclein in presynaptic terminals was in at least three different pools: (1) as unbound, soluble protein; (2) bound to presynaptic vesicles; and (3) as microaggregates. Serial imaging of microaggregates over 1 week demonstrated a heterogeneous population with differing  -synuclein exchange rates. The microaggregate species were resistant to proteinase K, phosphorylated at serine-129, oxidized, and associated with a decrease in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin and glutamate immunogold labeling. Multiphoton FRAP provided the specific binding constants for  -synuclein’s binding to synaptic vesicles and its effective diffusion coefficient in the soma and axon, setting the stage for future studies targeting synuclein modifications and their effects. Our in vivo results suggest that, under moderate overexpression conditions,  -synuclein aggregates are selectively found in presynaptic terminals.
\n
\n## Introduction
\n
\nAlpha-synuclein is a 140 aa protein localized to vertebrate pre- synaptic terminals. Although its exact function is unclear,  -synuclein binds synaptic vesicle membranes and likely assists vesicle trafficking and SNARE complex formation (Goedert, 2001; Norris et al., 2004; Rizo and Sudhof, 2012). Increases in  -synuclein levels lead to its abnormal aggregation and neuronal degeneration both in vitro (Zach et al., 2007; Outeiro et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010) and in vivo (Masliah et al., 2000; Giasson et al., 2002; Emmer et al., 2011). For example, multiplication muta- tions that increase expression levels by 50–100% cause Parkin- son’s disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; Singleton et al., 2003; Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004). Interestingly, these mutations are also associated with Lewy bodies and neurites, identi- cal to the more common sporadic forms of these diseases (Farrer et al., 2004). Because aggregated  -synuclein is the principal component of Lewy pathology, these observations strongly sug- gest that  -synuclein aggregation is a critical factor in the etiology of genetic and sporadic PD and DLB. Although much is known about factors that promote  -synuclein aggregation in vitro, in- cluding posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation (Fujiwara et al., 2002), oxidization (Hashimoto et al., 1999), and particular point mutations (Conway et al., 1998), how these fac- tors relate to aggregation in vivo is less well understood.

\nIn cell culture, overexpression of human  -synuclein in hip- pocampal neurons leads to its presynaptic aggregation (Scott et al., 2010) and deficits in neurotransmitter release (Nemani et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2010). However, examination of  -synuclein aggregation in living brain tissue has been limited. To determine binding and aggregation properties of  -synuclein in vivo, we adapted multiphoton fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) paradigms developed for studying fluorescent species in vitro (Brown et al., 1999; Mazza et al., 2008; Schnell et al., 2008; Sullivan and Brown, 2010) for in vivo studies of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged human  alpha-synuclein (Syn-GFP) in mouse cortex using cranial windows (Unni et al., 2010). Using the Syn- GFP transgenic mouse line and in vivo multiphoton imaging, we characterized in vivo Syn-GFP FRAP in mouse cortex and dem- onstrated that it is an accurate way to measure protein mobility. Under conditions of moderate  -synuclein overexpression (2- to 3-fold), levels similar to those seen in patients with multiplication mutations, the somatic Syn-GFP pool was entirely soluble and freely diffusible. In contrast, presynaptic Syn-GFP existed in at least three different pools, one of which was soluble and freely diffusible, whereas the other two had decreasing levels of mobil- ity. Binding constant measurements for  alpha-synuclein’s association and dissociation with presynaptic vesicles and its effective diffu- sion coefficient in different subcellular compartments in vivo suggest potentially important tools for future studies of the human-disease-associated point mutations (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997; Kru ̈ger et al., 1998; Zarranz et al., 2004). Our results demonstrate that in vivo multiphoton FRAP is a powerful tool for studies of protein aggregation and binding in living mouse brain and that, under moderate overexpression conditions mimicking human disease,  alpha-synuclein aggregation is selectively found at presynaptic terminals in vivo and is potentially related to their dysfunction.

\n## Materials and Methods
\n
\nAnimals. Syn-GFP (PDNG78; Rockenstein et al., 2005) heterozygous male mice were mated to BDF1 females from Charles River Labora- tories and housed by Oregon Health and Science University’s (OHSU’s) Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM). Thy1-GFP M-line animals were used for GFP-only control experiments. Animals were held in a light-dark cycle, temperature- and humidity- controlled animal vivarium and maintained under ad libitum food and water diet supplied by the DCM. All experiments were approved by the OHSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Animals between 1 and 18 months old were used, as specified in the text. Male and female mice were analyzed separately, but no significant differences were noted so combined results for both sexes are reported.
\nCranial window surgery and in vivo imaging. Cranial window sur- gery, in vivo imaging, and photobleaching were done similarly to previously published protocols (Unni et al., 2010). Briefly, isoflurane (1–2%)-anesthetized animals were placed in a custom-built stereo- taxic frame and surgery was performed to create an  5-mm-diameter circular craniotomy overlying primary sensory and motor cortex, which was closed with an 8-mm-diameter coverglass and a custom- built aluminum fixation bar cemented into place. On imaging days, isoflurane-anesthetized animals were mounted again into the stereo- taxic frame and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 7MP multiphoton micro- scope outfitted with dual channel BiG (binary GaAsP) detectors and the Coherent Technologies Chameleon titanium-sapphire femtosec- ond pulsed laser source (tuned to 860 nm). Zeiss Zen 2011 image acquisition software was used for all in vivo imaging. Baseline images of Syn-GFP-labeled pyramidal-shaped neurons and presynaptic ter- minals in cortical layers 2/3 were taken using 1–3 mW power (mea- sured at objective exit). Square, circular, or line regions of interest (ROI) were used for photobleaching, with bleach times  5 ms and  100 –150 mW power (measured at objective exit). Immediately af- ter photobleaching, images were acquired to follow the recovery time course of fluorescence using the baseline settings. For chronic synapse imaging experiments, animals were remounted into the stereotaxic frame and cortical surface blood vessel patterns and Syn-GFP- positive cell body profiles were used to reidentify previously imaged terminals.
\nImaging analysis. Images were analyzed with ImageJ or Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012) to obtain mean fluorescence values in rele- vant ROIs over time. FRAP data were then analyzed in Prism 5 (GraphPad) to obtain single exponential fits to the recovery time course and the immobile and mobile fractions. Calculations of the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) of Syn-GFP and bleach depth parameter   were made by fitting FRAP recovery curves using the least-squares curve fitting routine “lsqcurvefit” in MATLAB R2013a (The MathWorks) to previously established models for two-photon FRAP recovery kinetics in the soma (equation 8, Schnell et al., 2008) or in the axon (equation 1, Schmidt et al., 2007). Measurements of the bleaching radial and axial radii ( r and  z) needed for this fitting were made by photobleaching fixed tissue cortical sections from Syn-GFP mice using the same settings as used for the in vivo FRAP experiments. To check for possible excitation saturation during bleaching in our system, the bleach depth parameter   was measured as a function of bleaching laser power. This relationship was linear throughout the bleach power ranges used (data not shown), indicating the absence of excitation saturation.
\n
\nGiven that the immobile fraction of Syn-GFP present at terminals did not exchange with other Syn-GFP pools on the time scale of  24 h (see below), we calculated the fraction of free Syn-GFP available for binding to vesicles as the ratio of the amplitude of the fast-recovering component (tau  100 ms) over the sum of the amplitudes of the fast component and the next slower component (tau  2.6 min, repre- senting the vesicle-bound fraction, see below). This free fraction is equal to koff/(kon*   koff), where koff is the first-order “off” rate con- stant of Syn-GFP unbinding from vesicles and kon* is the pseudo- first-order “on” rate constant for Syn-GFP binding to vesicles, assuming a constant concentration of vesicle-binding sites on this time scale. This equivalency can be used to derive the ratio kon*/koff. Given that diffusion is much faster than the binding event, we fitted the slower component terminal FRAP recovery curves to an estab- lished model for extracting koff values (Sprague et al., 2004) and could then calculate kon*. To determine the relationship between the immo- bile fraction and total Syn-GFP present at a synapse, we developed a metric for assessing total Syn-GFP by comparing the prebleach inten- sity of a particular synapse to the whole distribution of terminal intensities, which is positively skewed and invariant in shape between animals and at different ages (Unni et al., 2010). This “synapse posi- tion” or “Sp” number was calculated for each bleached synapse by comparing the mean prebleach intensity of that synapse to the mode in the synapse intensity distribution as measured by the number of Sp units by which it was brighter than the mode. One Sp unit is defined as the distance between the mode intensity and the point where the mode intensity had decreased by 90%. This metric has the advantage of comparing terminal intensities with the internal distribution from which they are drawn, which was stable between animals (Unni et al., 2010) and therefore useful for comparisons between animals for which absolute measured intensity values vary. For chronic terminal imaging, individual bleached synapse intensities were normalized to the average of the same two to four unbleached terminals in the field on multiple imaging days to control for possible differences in imag- ing conditions present on different days.
\n
\nMouse brain removal, fixation, and sectioning. Whole brains were dis- sected from mice and the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs removed. Brains were divided into two along the midsagittal plane. Both hemi- spheres were placed in plastic scintillation vials with 4% paraformal- dehyde and fixed for 1 h, 150 W, at 30°C using a BioWave (Pelco) microwave fixation system. Hemispheres were postfixed in 4% para- formaldehyde overnight at 4°C and then stored in PBS containing sodium azide (0.05%). Fixed hemispheres were mounted on a Leica VT1000 S Vibratome and sagittally sectioned into 50  m slices. Slices were stored in PBS containing sodium azide at 4°C.
\n
\nProteinase K digestion. Tissue sections were washed 3 times in PBS to remove azide and then incubated in 0.05% SDS in PBS   10  g/ml proteinase K (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h at 37°C in the dark with shaking. Alternatively, free floating tissue sections were wet mounted on a slide using a Pap pen and incubated   10  g/ml proteinase K in 0.05% SDS/PBS for 5 min at 60°C in a dark, humidified chamber on a hot plate. Sections were washed 3 times, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal mi- croscope. For each condition, four cortical z-stack sections per animal for three animals were imaged and fluorescence was quantified for individual cell bodies and synapses using Fiji. Whole mouse brain was prepared for Western blot analysis via use of Syn-PER Synaptic Pro- tein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher), resulting in both a functional synaptosome fraction and a cytosolic fraction. Equal volumes of each fraction were then incubated with a 1:1 ratio of proteinase K stock solution (1 mg/ml proteinase K, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM CaCl, 50% glycerol in PBS) for 30 min at 37°C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of Novex Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subsequently heated to 95°C for 10 min. Samples were run on a 4 –12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) for 2 h and 45 min at 80 V. Gels were transferred onto Immobilon-FL membranes (0.45  m pore; Millipore) at 25 V for 18 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were probed with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4°C at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer. IR800 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Li-Cor) was used at a 1:15,000 dilution. Blot fluorescence was measured with a LI-COR Odyssey CLx and images analyzed using Image Studio software. The proteinase K-resistant fraction was measured as the ratio of treated versus untreated integrated band intensity.
\n
\nImmunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. Two anti- -synuclein antibodies were used, mouse monoclonal Syn303 (Covance) raised against oxidized  -synuclein species and rabbit monoclonal pSyn (Abcam) raised against serine-129 phosphorylated  -synuclein. Rab- bit anti-synapsin polyclonal antibody (Novex) was used to detect the synaptic vesicle protein synapsin 1 and mouse anti- -synuclein monoclonal antibody Syn1 (BD Biosciences) was used to detect mouse and human  -synuclein. Then 50  m fixed brain slices were washed 3 times in PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% Triton-X, 10% goat serum) for 2 h while shaking in the dark. Primary antibodies were used at 3  g/ml for Syn303 and 1.5  g/ml for pSyn in a 1:5 dilution of blocking buffer and incubated with shaking in the dark overnight at 4°C. Tissue was washed in PBS 5 times for 30 min each. Secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) were diluted to 1:2000 and subjected to incu- bated shaking in the dark overnight at 4°C. Tissue was washed in PBS 5 times for 30 min each at room temperature. Brain slices were mounted on slides in CFM-2 (Ted Pella), sealed with CoverGrip (Bi- otium), and allowed to dry overnight in the dark. Synapsin (0.4  g/ ml) and Syn1 (0.5  g/ml) staining was performed using microwave- assisted immunohistochemistry as described previously (Ferris et al., 2009) with a modified primary antibody incubation step of 12 min (4 on, 4 off, 4 on), followed by a 5 min rest step to increase antibody binding. For confocal imaging, sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63 /1.40 oil objective. Laser powers of 1–5% were used to acquire z-stacks through 2– 4 regions of cortex per tissue section. Fluorescence images were analyzed in Fiji, ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop, with only linear scaling of the pixel values. To quantify colocalization at synapses, we used the CoLoc parameter in Imaris data analysis software with a GFP fluorescence threshold of 0.1% to limit the analysis to only synapses and an antibody fluorescence threshold of 5% fluorescence.
\n
\nElectron microscopy and glutamate immunogold analysis. Electron microscopy (EM) and glutamate immunogold analysis were done similarly to previously published protocols (Walker et al., 2012). An- imals were perfused using a transcardiac approach with 0.5% para- formaldehyde/1% glutaraldehyde/0.1% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature. The primary sensory and motor cortex was processed for EM pre-embed diaminobenzidine (DAB) immunolabeling for localization of GFP (GFP rabbit polyclonal anti- body, 1:1000; Fitzgerald) using a microwave procedure. Tissue was incubated in the microwave (Pelco BioWave; Ted Pella) for 5 min, 550 W, at 35°C with the vacuum off (all the remaining steps occurred at this temperature) in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0 (antigen retrieval), rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 2   1 min at 150 W with the vacuum off, exposed to 3% hydrogen peroxide at 150 W for 1 min with the vacuum on, rinsed in PB at 150 W for 2   1 min with the vacuum off, exposed to 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, 550 W with the vacuum on, washed in PB for 2   1 min at 200 W with the vacuum off, then exposed to the primary antibody for 12 min at 200 W 4 times using the following cycle: 2 min on, 2 min off, 2 min on, 5 min off, all on a continuous vacuum. The tissue is then rinsed in PB twice at 1 min each at 150 W with the vacuum off, and then exposed to the secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, 1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 15 min at 200 W for 2 cycles of the following: 4 min on, 3 min off, 4 min on, 5 min off, all on a continuous vacuum. The tissue is then rinsed in PB, 2   1 min, at 150 W with the vacuum off and then exposed to ABC (Vector Elite Kit, 1  l/ml solution A and B in PB) for 11 min at 150 W under vacuum using the following cycle: 4 min on, 3 min off, 4 min on. The tissue was then rinsed in PB twice at 1 min each, at 150 W with the vacuum off and then exposed to DAB (0.5  g/ml   1.5% hydrogen peroxide) for up to 10 min at room temperature.
\n
\nPostembedding immunogold electron microscopy was performed us- ing a glutamate antibody (non-affinity-purified, rabbit polyclonal; Sigma). Thin sections (60 nm) were cut on an ultramicrotome (EM UC7; Leica) along the leading edge of the cortical tissue block, where layers I-VI were exposed, using a diamond knife (Diatome). The primary glutamate antibody, as described previously (Phend et al., 1992), was diluted 1:250 in TBST 7.6 and aspartate (1 mM) was added to the glutamate antibody mixture 24 h before incubation with the thin-sectioned tissue to prevent any cross-reactivity with aspartate within the tissue. The secondary anti- body was goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; diluted 1:25 in TBST, pH 8.2) tagged with 12 nm gold particles. We previously reported that incubation of the antibody with 3 mM glutamate resulted in no immunogold labeling, showing the specificity of the glutamate labeling (Meshul et al., 1994). Photographs (10/animal) were taken on a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope of Syn-GFP-labeled and Syn- GFP-unlabeled terminals from a single 50 mesh grid (1 thin section/grid, 1 photograph/grid square) throughout the neuropil (an area containing the highest numbers of synapses) of layers II and III at a final magnifica- tion of 40,000  by an individual blinded to the experimental groups, using a digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). For all Syn- GFP-immunolabeled terminals and non-Syn-GFP-labeled terminals, the density of immunogold labeling was determined in each terminal at the ages mentioned.
\nFor quantification of glutamate labeling, the number of immuno- gold particles located within or at least touching the synaptic vesicle membrane (i.e., vesicular pool), the number located outside the syn- aptic vesicles (i.e., the cytoplasmic pool), and those associated with mitochondria were counted. The vesicular and cytoplasmic pools were combined because the cytoplasmic pool is very small ( 10%) compared with the vesicular pool (Meshul et al., 1999). We have reported that nerve terminals making a symmetrical contact contain GABA (Meshul et al., 1999), the precursor for which is glutamate. Therefore, nerve terminals making a symmetrical contact will natu- rally contain some glutamate immunolabeling and cannot be consid- ered immunonegative as a way of determining a ratio between glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals (Meshul et al., 1994, 1999). The metabolic pool is also relatively small and thus unlikely to be a major source of variation in labeling intensity. The density of gold particles per square micrometer of nerve terminal area was deter- mined for each animal and the mean density for each group calcu- lated. Background labeling was determined within glial cell processes and was found to be 10 immunogold-labeled particles per square micrometer (Meshul et al., 1994). This was subtracted from the den- sity of presynaptic immunogold-labeled glutamate within the nerve terminals.

\n## Results
\n
\nSomatic  -synuclein exists in a single soluble pool
\nTo measure potential fast dynamics of Syn-GFP within the cell bodies of layer 2/3 primary sensory and motor cortex neurons in our mice, we performed a series of FRAP experiments in line scan mode that allowed us to acquire recovery data with a time reso- lution of up to 1 ms. Syn-GFP demonstrated a fast recovery tau that was well fit by a single exponential (23.4   7.4 ms, n   7 cells, 4 animals; Fig. 1 A, B), similar to recovery in a different mouse line expressing soluble, monomeric GFP within cortical neurons (26.7   8.2 ms, n   12 cells, 2 animals, p   0.40; Fig. 1 A, B). This suggests that somatic Syn-GFP, like free GFP, exists predominantly in a soluble, freely diffusible state without appreciable binding to somatic membranous compartments. We also mea- sured FRAP recovery curves for Syn-GFP using square ROIs to estimate Deff in vivo. Square ROIs were used because this simpli- fies the assessment of model parameters needed for estimating Deff. We fit recovery curves using established methods for extract- ing Deff from multiphoton FRAP data (Brown et al., 1999; Schnell et al., 2008; Sullivan and Brown, 2010; Fig. 1C) to calculate the in vivo Deff of Syn-GFP (see Materials and Methods). The in vivo Deff for somatic Syn-GFP was 8.6   3.8  m2/s (n   14 cells, 4 ani- mals), which was somewhat less than predicted for a soluble, monomeric Syn-GFP fusion protein ( 13–34  m2/s) based on the molecular weight of the fusion protein and Deff of cytoplasmic GFP in cultured cells (Yokoe and Meyer, 1996; Arrio-DuPont et al., 2000; Sprague et al., 2004;  15– 40  m 2/s).
\n
\n## In vivo FRAP accurately measures  -synuclein mobility in mouse cortex
\n
\nOur previous work suggested that FRAP could be a useful tool for studying mechanisms of  -synuclein aggregation in the living mouse brain on the time scale of minutes (Unni et al., 2010). However, to assess FRAP recovery of Syn-GFP on a millisecond time scale, one must consider the possibility of reversible dark state recovery of GFP. In addition to irreversible GFP photo- bleaching, under certain conditions, photobleaching GFP temporarily converts it into a reversible “dark state” (Swaminathan et al., 1997; Mueller et al., 2012) that recovers on the order of hun- dreds of microseconds to milliseconds.
\n
\nWe performed several experiments to test for possible dark state recovery. In FRAP experiments in which signal recovery is dominated by protein movement from unbleached regions into the bleached region, recovery will be slower with larger bleach ROIs. In contrast, reversible dark state recovery of GFP involves an intramolecular reaction that is independent of the size of the bleached area (Swaminathan et al., 1997). Therefore, we bleached different-sized ROIs within the same neuron sequentially, mea- suring the rate of recovery for each bleach size (Fig. 2A). Syn-GFP FRAP showed a slower recovery tau when a 4-fold larger bleach area was compared with the smaller bleach area (mean tau ratio large ROI/small ROI   1.79, 95% confidence interval   1.41– 2.16, range   1.03–3.02, n   13 cells, 4 animals; Fig. 2B). A plot of the absolute recovery tau versus bleach area also showed a signif- icant positive correlation, as expected for movement of un- bleached Syn-GFP into the bleached area (r 2   0.38, p   0.001, n   26, 4 animals; Fig. 2C). Finally, we saw no recovery of Syn- GFP FRAP in fixed tissue sections of cortex (data not shown). Dark state recovery of GFP can occur in fixed tissue (Mueller et al., 2012) in which protein movement on the micron scale is precluded, strongly suggesting that the rapid recovery of somatic Syn-GFP FRAP signal that we measured represents true protein movement within neurons.
\n
\n## Presynaptic terminal  -synuclein exists in at least three different pools, each with different mobility
\n
\nTo measure Syn-GFP mobility in vivo within presynaptic termi- nals, as defined as fluorescent neuropil puncta (Unni et al., 2010), we used FRAP in line scan mode. Unlike the soma, individual terminals showed slower recovery that was not well fit by a single exponential. The fastest component in terminals was well fit by a single exponential with a tau of 102   51 ms (n   11 synapses, 4 animals; Fig. 3A). This component comprised only 23   9% of total terminal Syn-GFP. In contrast, bleaching of free GFP in presynaptic terminals recovered completely with a tau of 122   62 ms (n   9 synapses, 2 animals, p   0.43, t test; Fig. 3B). This suggests that only a small fraction of Syn-GFP in presynaptic terminals is soluble and freely diffusible. Although the rate of recovery for the fast component in presynaptic terminals was slower than the soma, this difference is likely due to geometrical barriers to diffusion present in thin axonal processes rather than binding interactions. Further support for this idea came from measuring Deff in the axonal compartment using multiphoton FRAP recovery (Schmidt et al., 2007) compared with the mea- sured value of Deff in the soma. Measuring axonal Deff in this way requires assuming one-dimensional diffusion along thin axonal processes, which was validated for parvalbumin in axons of cer- ebellar Purkinje neurons in acute slices (Schmidt et al., 2007). We measured an axonal Deff for Syn-GFP of 9.0   6.6  m 2/s (n   11 synapses, 3 animals; Fig. 3C,D), which was very similar to the measured Deff in the soma (8.6   3.8  m 2/s, p   0.85, t test; Fig. 3D). This similarity suggests that a portion of terminal Syn-GFP is freely diffusible and that the one-dimensional diffusion ap- proximation for soluble protein mobility in the axon is valid in vivo, as it is in slices (Schmidt et al., 2007). Although measure- ments from small axonal processes potentially suffer from lower signal-to-noise levels, our data show that multiphoton imaging provides high-quality data from even these small volume struc- tures. A rough estimate of the magnitude of the constraint that axonal geometry places on the diffusion of a soluble protein of this size in vivo can be made by taking the ratio of the recovery tau measured using line scan FRAP in the presynaptic terminal and the soma, which demonstrates a  5-fold slower recovery in the axonal compartment.
\n
\nUsing FRAP with circular ROIs encompassing individual terminals (Unni et al., 2010), we measured two additional components of Syn-GFP recovery, one well fit by a single ex- ponential recovery tau of 2.6   2.5 min (n   22 synapses, 7 animals) comprising 45   21% of total terminal Syn-GFP (n   19 synapses, 5 animals; Fig. 4 A, B). The remaining 32   21% of total terminal Syn-GFP (n   19 synapses, 5 animals) did not recover over the course of 10 min, comprising essen- tially an immobile fraction (IF) on this time scale. In contrast, circular ROI bleaching studies of individual terminals in GFP transgenic animals demonstrated a much faster recovery tau of 5.1   3.7 s (n   6 synapses, 2 animals), consistent with a homogenous population of soluble GFP. The recovery of sol- uble GFP was slower than in our line scan experiments, likely because of differences in bleach area and time when using the two different bleach ROI conditions. The IF of Syn-GFP in each terminal (ranged from 0 to 83%) and was correlated with the total amount of Syn-GFP present before bleaching (r2   0.26, p   0.03, n   19 synapses, 5 animals; Fig. 4C), suggesting that synapses with greater Syn-GFP have more immobilized protein. In contrast, there was no correlation between the recovery tau and IF size at each synapse (r 2   0.001, p   0.89, n   19 synapses, 5 animals). Next we used a slightly modified technique that bleached a larger square area ROI (53 53  m 2) encompassing 50 –100 terminals simultaneously. This allowed us to measure FRAP recovery data on a pooled group of synapses more efficiently to get better estimates of the pop- ulation as opposed to bleaching each terminal one-by-one. The terminal recovery parameters measured in this way were indistinguishable from our individual terminal bleaching ex- periments (individual terminal FRAP recovery tau   2.6   2.5 min, n   22 synapses, 7 animals; area FRAP recovery tau   1.9   1.3 min, n   78,652  m2, 9 animals; t test p   0.47; individual terminal FRAP IF   42   21%, n   19 synapses, 5 animals; area FRAP IF   49   11%, n   78,652  m2, 9 ani- mals; t test p   0.42). Using this approach, we measured FRAP parameters from animals of different ages, including 1, 3–6, and 12–18 months of age (1 month IF: 45   10%, 3– 6 month IF: 48   1%, 12–18 month IF: 55   17%, one-way ANOVA p   0.62; Fig. 4D; 1 month tau: 1.2   0.9 min, 3– 6 month tau: 1.8   1.0 min, 12–18 month tau: 2.8   1.4 min, one-way ANOVA p   0.18; Fig. 4E; n   3 animals per age group). Interestingly, the IF and recovery tau values measured did not vary significantly over this age range. Using the percent free and vesicle-bound Syn-GFP in the ter- minal, the ratio of free/(free   vesicle bound) Syn-GFP was 34   17%. Assuming a simple second-order binding reaction for asso- ciation of Syn-GFP with vesicles (see Materials and Methods), we calculated the ratio of kon*/koff to be 1.96   1.10 in vivo. This calculation assumes a constant concentration of vesicle binding sites on this time scale. Given that diffusion is fast compared with the binding rate, we used established FRAP analysis methods (Sprague et al., 2004) to obtain koff   6.47   3.74   10 3 sec 1 and kon*   12.7   10.2   10 3 sec 1.
\n
\nLong-term imaging of individual bleached Syn-GFP-positive terminals over the time scale of several hours to 1 week revealed that there was no further recovery of FRAP signal after the first several minutes or over the course of 1–2 h after the bleach nor was further fluorescence recovery seen 24 h later. However, 7–9 d after bleaching, some terminals demonstrated full recovery (Fig. 5 A, B), whereas other terminals showed only partial or no recov- ery of the IF. On average, presynaptic Syn-GFP signal had recov- ered to 67   25% of total Syn-GFP by 1 d after bleaching and was significantly higher (79   34% of total Syn-GFP) at 7–9 d after bleaching (n   20 synapses, 3 animals, paired t test p   0.02; Fig. 5C). Therefore,  36% of the IF from the first 10 min after the bleach eventually recovered after 7–9 d. This indicates that the IF component is heterogeneous, with more than one Syn-GFP ex- change rate.

\n## Pool of presynaptic  -synuclein is proteinase K resistant
\n
\nAlthough in vivo multiphoton FRAP is a useful tool for mea- suring the mobility of different Syn-GFP species at presynaptic terminals, the molecular nature of these different pools is un- clear. To better characterize Syn-GFP in cortical tissue, we treated fixed tissue sections and synaptosome-fractionated fresh brain tissue with proteinase K. Then, tissue sections were imaged with confocal microscopy and synaptosome fractions assayed by Western blotting to determine whether a proteinase K-resistant fraction was present. Proteinase K-resistance is a well established hallmark of certain aggregated species of  -synuclein (Takeda et al., 1998; Miake et al., 2002) and other neurodegeneration-associated proteins (Neumann et al., 2002). Although both somatic staining and the cytosolic frac- tion of Syn-GFP were almost completely abolished by proteinase K treatment (normalized somatic Syn-GFP signal in fixed tissue after proteinase K   0.042   0.041, n   3 animals; normalized cyto- solic fraction Syn-GFP signal in freshly prepared tissue after proteinase K   0.015   0.013, n   3 animals), a signif- icant fraction of presynaptic terminal Syn-GFP was not degraded by protei- nase K (normalized terminal Syn-GFP signal after proteinase K   0.44   0.21, n   3 animals, paired t test p   0.02; normalized synaptosome fraction Syn- GFP signal after proteinase K   0.35   0.13, n   3 animals, t test p   0.02), suggesting that aggregates were present only in presynaptic terminals (Fig. 6A– C). Mean Syn-GFP terminal intensity comparing slices from the same animal showed that proteinase K treatment re- sulted in a decrease in the frequency of “dim” terminals, with a relative sparing of the “bright” terminals (Fig. 6D), suggesting that terminals with high levels of Syn- GFP contain more of the aggregate form. We also measured the average terminal volume of Syn-GFP labeling under con- trol conditions and after proteinase K treatment. Interestingly, proteinase K treatment reduced terminal Syn-GFP vol- ume by  25% (average control volume   0.41   0.54  m 3, n   46,117 terminals, 3 animals; average proteinase K-treated volume   0.31   0.17  m3, n   24,009 terminals, 3 animals). Next, we measured the fraction of proteinase K-resistant Syn- GFP in terminals in different age groups. When comparing mice aged 1, 3–6, and 12–18 months, we detected no significant differences in the proteinase K-resistant fraction (data not shown) in these age groups, in agreement with our in vivo imaging data showing a similar IF across the ages tested.

\n## Pool of presynaptic  -synuclein is phosphorylated at serine- 129, oxidized, and associated with decreases in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin
\n
\nTo characterize the Syn-GFP aggregates in terminals, we stained fixed tissue for several molecular markers of specific aggregates. Serine-129 phosphorylation is a marker of  -synuclein aggregation and serine-129 phospho-antibodies stain Lewy pathology from hu- man tissue (Fujiwara et al., 2002) and aggregated  -synuclein in some mouse models (Emmer et al., 2011; Luk et al., 2012a,b). However, recent work has suggested that serine-129 phosphorylation is required for autophagy-mediated  -synuclein degradation and marks a pool that is not necessarily aggregated (Oueslati et al., 2013). In addition, in some mouse models (Tanji et al., 2010), there is evidence that presynaptic terminal proteinase K-resistant  -synuclein aggregates can exist without being phosphorylated at

\nPool of presynaptic  alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine- 129, oxidized, and associated with decreases in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin
\nTo characterize the Syn-GFP aggregates in terminals, we stained fixed tissue for several molecular markers of specific aggregates. Serine-129 phosphorylation is a marker of  -synuclein aggregation and serine-129 phospho-antibodies stain Lewy pathology from hu- man tissue (Fujiwara et al., 2002) and aggregated  -synuclein in some mouse models (Emmer et al., 2011; Luk et al., 2012a,b). How- ever, recent work has suggested that serine-129 phosphorylation is required for autophagy-mediated  alpha-synuclein degradation and marks a pool that is not necessarily aggregated (Oueslati et al., 2013). In addition, in some mouse models (Tanji et al., 2010), there is evidence that presynaptic terminal proteinase K-resistant  alpha-synuclein aggregates can exist without being phosphorylated at serine-129. Oxidization of  -synuclein is another modification associated with human disease and this form is also present in Lewy pathology (Giasson et al., 2000). Therefore, we next mea- sured the serine-129 phosphorylation and oxidation status of terminal Syn-GFP aggregates in our system.
\n
\nIn our experiments, a subset of Syn-GFP-positive presyn- aptic terminals in the cortex colabeled with serine-129 phos- phorylated  -synuclein (Fig. 7A). However, the phosphorylated form was not detected in neuronal cell bodies (data not shown). Likewise, staining for oxidized  -synuclein colabeled with some Syn-GFP-positive presynaptic terminals (Fig. 7A), but not in cell bodies. There was also a significant positive correlation between the amount of serine-129-phosphorylated  -synuclein and the total Syn-GFP at each terminal, indicating that terminals with greater amounts of Syn-GFP contained more phosphorylated protein (r 2   0.34, p   0.0003, n   37 synapses; Fig. 7B). These results are consis- tent with the correlation between total Syn-GFP levels and the IF measured by in vivo imaging (Fig. 4C), indicating the presence of more aggregated protein in brightly labeled Syn-GFP terminals. To quantify the amount of colocalization between Syn-GFP and phospho-synuclein, we calculated the Pearson’s colocalization coefficient using Imaris software and found a significant amount of co- localization in Syn-GFP-positive presynaptic terminals (Pearson’s coefficient   0.194   0.042, n   3 animals, 4 cortical areas per animal; Fig. 7C). Next, we measured serine-129-phosphorylated  -synuclein levels in cortical terminals treated with proteinase K to determine whether the proteinase K-resistant fraction is phosphor- ylated. Using our protocol, phospho-synuclein staining was abol- ished by proteinase K treatment (data not shown). This suggests that these two aggregate pools are separate and that the proteinase K-resistant fraction is not phosphorylated at this residue, as is seen for presynaptic terminal aggregates in other human  alpha-synuclein overexpression transgenic models (Tanji et al., 2010). Furthermore, markers of amyloid-like aggregate species, thioflavine S (ThS), and mature Lewy pathology (anti-ubiquitin antibody staining) showed no clear colocalization with Syn-GFP-positive terminals (data not shown). Combined, these data suggest that the proteinase K-resistant, serine-129-phosphorylated, oxidized Syn-GFP presynaptic aggregate pools are not ubiquitinated or in an amyloid (ThS-binding) conformation.
\n
\nOur data presented above from in vivo imaging and protei- nase K digestion suggests that an aggregated pool of Syn-GFP in presynaptic terminals forms as early as 1 month after birth in this line and is present at relatively constant levels until the animals are  1 year-old. We next investigated whether these aggregates might be associated with evidence of terminal dys- function, as has been suggested to occur when  -synuclein is overexpressed (Scott et al., 2010; Larson et al., 2012; Scott and Roy, 2012). For example, Roy et al. demonstrated what they termed “vacant synapses” in a subset of terminals expressing Syn-GFP aggregates, which contained greatly reduced levels of several presynaptic vesicle proteins involved in exocytosis (Scott et al., 2010). We determined the levels of the vesicle protein synapsin in Syn-GFP-expressing versus Syn-GFP- nonexpressing cortical terminals (Fig. 7A) and found that Syn-GFP-expressing terminals had a large decrease in synap- sin staining in all age groups tested (1, 3– 6, or 12–18 months old; data not shown). The Pearson’s coefficient for colocaliza- tion between Syn-GFP-positive terminals and synapsin was close to zero, indicating that the proteins do not colocalize (Pearson’s   0.026   0.040, n   3, 1 year-old animals, 2 cortical areas per animal; Fig. 7C). In contrast, synapsin did colocalize with an antibody that recognizes mouse  -synuclein (Syn1), indicating that adjacent neurons that do not express the transgene likely have healthy synaptic function (Pearson’s   0.36   0.12, n   3, 1-year-old animals, 2 cortical areas per animal; Fig. 7C). These data suggest that presynaptic Syn-GFP aggregates are toxic to the normal exo- cytotic apparatus.

\n## Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates vesicle-bound and granular aggregate forms of terminal  -synuclein
\n
\nTo characterize the ultrastructural properties of Syn-GFP in cortical presynaptic terminals, we used EM pre-embedding DAB immunolabeling (Meshul and McGinty, 2000) with an anti-GFP antibody and a newly developed microwave fixa- tion/processing procedure (Walker et al., 2012). Syn-GFP- containing terminals showed two different patterns of DAB staining (Fig. 8A). The more common pattern was perivesicular labeling of Syn-GFP, which likely corresponds to the pre- sumed synaptic vesicle binding pool of Syn-GFP detected with in vivo FRAP. Association of  -synuclein with synap- tic vesicles has been described previ- ously (Maroteaux and Scheller, 1991; Shibayama-Imazu et al., 1993). We also ob- served a more granular pattern of Syn-GFP staining not associated with vesicles in a subset of terminals making both an inhibi- tory (symmetrical; Fig. 8A) and excitatory (asymmetrical; Fig. 8B) synaptic contacts. This appearance resembled the granular ag- gregates of  -synuclein seen in human (Sone et al., 2005) and mouse (Rockenstein et al., 2005; Rieker et al., 2011) tissue. This granular pattern may represent the aggregated, immobile Syn-GFP pool observed in our in vivo FRAP and ex vivo proteinase K experiments.

\n## Glutamate immunogold labeling demonstrates progressive dysfunction of  -synuclein-overexpressing terminals
\n
\nSeveral groups of investigators have sug- gested that  -synuclein overexpression can lead to synaptic dysfunction that can be measured at the ultrastructural level in dif- ferent systems (Scott et al., 2010, Scott and Roy, 2012; Larson et al., 2012). We per- formed quantitative immunogold analysis in the cortex of our transgenic mice to detect presynaptic glutamate in Syn-GFP-labeled versus Syn-GFP-unlabeled terminals at different ages. Glutamate immunogold la- beling can be used to detect this neurotrans- mitter in excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals, because glutamate is the direct precursor to GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian cortex (Meshul et al., 1994; Bamford et al., 2004). Our immunogold labeling in 3-month-old animals showed no significant differences in the density of particles in both asymmetric (unlabeled: 117   4.6 particles/ m2, Syn- GFP-labeled:96 19,ttestp 0.78,n 3 animals; Fig. 8C, error   SEM) and sym- metric (unlabeled: 97   3.5 particles/ m2,

In 9-month-old animals, however, a significant decrease in presynaptic glutamate immunogold labeling in Syn- GFP-positive asymmetric terminals (unlabeled: 74   4.2 particles/  m 2, Syn-GFP-labeled: 29   2.3, t test p   0.001, n   3 animals; Fig. 8B, error   SEM) was seen, which was also the case for terminals making a symmetrical synaptic contact (unlabeled: 89   16 parti- cles/ m 2, Syn-GFP-labeled: 20   2, t test p   0.01, n   3 animals). These data suggest that Syn-GFP overexpression, which we have shown is associated with presynaptic terminal microaggregate for mation at an early age, is also associated with an age-dependent decrease in glutamate im- munogold labeling in excitatory (asymmet- rical) and inhibitory (symmetrical) nerve terminals.
\n
\n## Discussion
\n
\nIn previous work, we showed the feasibil- ity of using in vivo multiphoton FRAP to measure recovery of Syn-GFP in mouse cortex (Unni et al., 2010). In our current work, we expanded these methods to charac- terize Syn-GFP FRAP rigorously in vivo and demonstrate that it is an accurate way to mea- sure protein mobility free from confounding artifacts seen in other systems. We demon- strate that, under conditions of moderate  -synuclein overexpression, similar to mul- tiplication mutations that lead to human disease, in vivo aggregation is selectively found at presynaptic terminals starting at an early age (at least by 1 month of age), is not detectable in cell bodies, and is associated with significant decreases in the important presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin. In ad- dition, we measured the effective diffusion coefficient of Syn-GFP within different sub- cellular compartments, the relative fraction within free and bound terminal pools, the vesicle binding constants kon* and koff, and the exchange rate within terminal mi- croaggregates. All of these numbers have been impossible to measure in vivo in the brain until now. Our EM analysis demon- strates that Syn-GFP overexpression leads to progressive dysfunction, as measured by a decrease in presynaptic glutamate immunogold labeling in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
\n
\nOur results suggest that somatic Syn- GFP is soluble and freely diffusible, whereas in presynaptic terminals, at least three dif- ferent pools exist, one of which is soluble and freely diffusible. The other two lower mobility pools have very different recovery kinetics from each other, one on the order of 2.6 min and the other over several days or longer. Given substantial evidence that -synuclein normally binds presynaptic vesicles (Maroteaux and Scheller, 1991; Shibayama-Imazu et al., 1993; Davidson et al., 1998), including our own EM data showing perivesicular staining and data from cell-free systems demonstrating synaptosomal binding on the minutes time scale (Wislet-Gendebien et al., 2006, 2008), the pool with a  2.6 min recovery tau in our experiments likely represents soluble Syn-GFP binding to synaptic vesicles. The final presynaptic Syn-GFP species measured is more heterogeneous, with individual terminals showing no, partial, or complete recovery within 7–9 d. This pool likely rep- resents an  -synuclein microaggregate form. Its different recovery characteristics may be due to different maturation states, with more compact microaggregates exhibiting decreased Syn-GFP exchange. This kind of sequential compaction has been hypothesized to occur in human disease as part of a pathway toward Lewy pathology for- mation (Dale et al., 1992; Arima et al., 1998; Go ́ mez-Tortosa et al., 2000). It is important to note that our in vivo FRAP imaging is lim- ited for technical reasons to cells and synapses within superficial cortical layers (all data presented are from layers 2/3). Therefore, the potential somatic aggregation profile in deeper brain regions may not be the same as we measure here. It will be interesting in future studies to use alternative techniques, potentially including fiber- optic approaches (Flusberg et al., 2005; Murray and Levene, 2012), to probe the somatic aggregation profile of deeper structures. Pairing this with multicolor labeling approaches could help determine the IF in cortical terminals originating from different neuronal cell types throughout the brain.
\n
\nOur biochemical characterization also supports the presence of terminal Syn-GFP microaggregate species because proteinase K-resistant, serine-129-phosphorylated, and oxidized forms of Syn- GFP are present only in presynaptic terminals. These three specific  -synuclein modifications are common in PD and DLB human tis- sue (Takeda et al., 1998; Giasson et al., 2000; Fujiwara et al., 2002). We find that, depending on technique, 44   21% (confocal imaging in fixed tissue) or 35   13% (Western blotting of fresh tissue) of Syn-GFP in the synapse is proteinase K-resistant, which closely matches the 32   21% IF we detected with in vivo FRAP experiments, suggesting that this may be the same aggregate pool. Our measurements of the age dependence of ag- gregate formation suggest that a proteinase K-resistant, relatively immobile, Syn-GFP aggregate pool, which is not clearly phos- phorylated at serine-129, develops as early as 1 month of age. This fraction is associated with toxicity because there is coincident re- duction in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin. In addition, our quantitative im- munogold measurements show an age- dependent decrease in terminal glutamate labeling in Syn-GFP-containing synapses. We speculate, based on this evidence, that terminal microaggregates represent an early stage in the synucleinopathy pathologic cas- cade, forming first at presynaptic terminals because of the high local concentration of this protein here. These proteinase K-resistant aggregates could be causing im- mediate presynaptic abnormalities, as evidenced by the lack of synapsin in these synapses, but may also trigger a second slower process of degeneration requiring months to develop, which leads to decreased presynaptic neurotransmitter levels. Ulti- mately, this chronic synaptic dysfunction may lead to a “dying back” of affected ax- onal processes, as has been postulated to occur in several synucleinopathies (Adal- bert and Coleman, 2012; Yasuda et al., 2013). Alternatively, it is possible that the presynaptic microaggregates we measure may be beneficial because evidence sug- gests that certain  -synuclein aggregate species may be cytoprotective, potentially sequestering other more toxic species such as small oligomers (Nakamura et al., 2011) and therefore reducing neurode- generation (Tofaris and Spillantini, 2005; Bodner et al., 2006). Finally, it is also pos- sible that the presynaptic microaggregates are an epiphenomenon that is not linked directly to presynaptic dysfunction in an either helpful or harmful way. In this case, the microaggregates may be marking ter- minals where another toxic species is me- diating detrimental effects on synapsin and glutamate levels. Therefore, exploring these mechanisms further, including the distinct roles of posttranslationally modified and proteinase K-resistant

Bottom, Group data from animals of two different age groups, 3 and 9 months old, showing a significant decrease in presynaptic glutamate levels in 9-month-old Syn-GFP-positive excitatory (asymmetrical) and inhibitory (symmetrical) nerve terminals. -synuclein terminal species in this system, will be an impor- tant avenue for future research. Interestingly, recent work sug- gests that serine-129 phosphorylation, specifically by Polo-like kinase 2, marks a pool which is in the process of being disaggre- gated and degraded by autophagy (Oueslati et al., 2013).
\n
\nSeveral groups of investigators have reported  -synuclein FRAP data in different systems (Fortin et al., 2005; van Ham et al., 2008). Most recently, Roberti et al. (2011) reported results from SHY-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell cultures using the biarsenical labeling compound ReAsH. Somatic aggregates and unaggregated protein were imaged by confocal microscopy. Within aggregates, one immobile and one mobile species were present. The IF within aggregates was  85% of total tagged synuclein, whereas the mobile fraction had a D eff of 0.035  m2/s. These results differ substantially from ours because we detected a single, freely diffusible Syn-GFP population within cortical neuron somata in vivo (Deff   8.6   3.8  m2/s) and 3 pools of Syn-GFP with differing levels of mobility ranging from milliseconds to days in synaptic terminals. It will be interesting to determine the nature of the  -synuclein species in these different systems and whether they share significant overlap or not.

It will be interesting to determine the nature of the  -synuclein species in these different systems and whether they share significant overlap or not.
\n
\nOur measurements of free Syn-GFP mobility, both in the soma and terminals, are experimentally indistinguishable from those we made for free GFP in these compartments, suggesting that free Syn-GFP may be monomeric. However, previous work has shown limitations of FRAP to resolve small differences in molecular weight. For example, it has been suggested that molec- ular weight changes of  10-fold are required before being clearly detected by FRAP (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001). If this is the case, the freely soluble pool of Syn-GFP we detect could exist as small ( 10-mer) multimers. We can confidently say, however, that they are not larger multimers ( 10-mers). Determining whether small multimers such as tetramers exist in vivo will be an interesting avenue for future studies because their presence is controversial (Bartels et al., 2011; Fauvet et al., 2012; Dettmer et al., 2013). Other fluorescence-based techniques adapted for in vivo use, such as fluorescent protein complementation, fluores- cence correlation spectroscopy, or fluorescence resonance energy transfer, may be useful to answer this question.
\n
\nExpression levels of Syn-GFP in this mouse line are two to three times that seen in normal human brain (Rockenstein et al., 2005), similar to patient tissue with multiplication mutations (Singleton et al., 2003). Therefore, these Syn-GFP mice may rep- resent a good model for the neuropathology that underlies early stages of synucleinopathy. Using a variety of techniques, includ- ing in vivo multiphoton imaging, proteinase K digestion, immu- nohistochemistry, and EM, we have demonstrated the presence of human  alpha-synuclein aggregates specifically in presynaptic ter- minals with a positive dose-aggregate relationship. In addition, we have not found evidence for somatic aggregates. This suggests that an early step underlying synucleinopathies is the develop- ment of specifically presynaptic aggregates. It will be interesting in future studies to pair this model with other factors implicated in disease pathogenesis, including mitochondrial toxins (Betar- bet et al., 2000; Uversky et al., 2001), point mutations (Polymero- poulos et al., 1997; Kru ̈ger et al., 1998; Zarranz et al., 2004), or inoculation with potentially prion-like  -synuclein aggregates (Luk et al., 2012a, 2012b; Masuda-Suzukake et al., 2013). This will allow testing of the hypothesis that presynaptic aggregate pathology, given specific triggers, can cause spreading of aggre- gation to the soma, as predicted by several groups of investigators (Galvin et al., 1999; Marui et al., 2002; Kramer and Schulz- Schaeffer, 2007). In addition, this model, with aggregation lim- ited to presynaptic terminals, may be useful for the study of therapies thought to only be beneficial early in the course of disease.
