  \n# Abstract
  \n
  \nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer great hope for in vitro modeling of Parkinson’s disease (PD), as well as for designing cell-replacement therapies. To realize these opportunities, there is an urgent need to develop efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of
  \nhESC/iPSC into dopamine (DA) neurons with the specific characteristics of the cell
  \npopulation lost to PD, i.e., A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons. Here we use
  \nlentiviral vectors to drive the expression of LMX1A, which encodes a transcription
  \nfactor critical for ventral midbrain identity, specifically in neural progenitor cells. We show that clonal lines of hESC engineered to contain one or two copies of this lentiviral vector retain long-term self- renewing ability and pluripotent differentiation capacity. Greater than 60% of all neurons generated from LMX1A-engineered hESC were ventral midbrain DA neurons of the A9 subtype, compared with *10% in green fluorescent protein–engineered controls, as judged by specific marker expression and functional analyses. Moreover, DA neuron precursors differentiated from LMX1A-engineered hESC were able to survive and differentiate when grafted into the brain of adult mice. Finally, we provide evidence that LMX1A overexpression similarly increases the yield of DA neuron differentiation from human iPSC. Taken together, our data show that stable genetic engineering of hESC/iPSC with lentiviral vectors driving controlled expression of LMX1A is an efficient way to generate enriched populations of human A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons, which should prove useful for modeling PD and may be helpful for designing future cell-replacement strategies.

  \n# Introduction
  \n
  \nParkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable, chronically progressive condition characterized by the continuing degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons projecting from the midbrain substantia nigra to the basal ganglia striatum (Marsden, 1990). Current symptomatic therapies, consisting primarily of pharmacological DA replacement, compensate the movement deficit efficiently over a period of several years, but are ineffective in alleviating the loss of autonomic and cognitive abilities. Moreover, current treatments are met with late complications, which might be due, at least partially, to neurotoxicity of the drugs. The localized loss of a specialized neuronal cell popula- tion, paired with the urgent need for long-term treatment options, makes cell replacement therapy a promising approach to treat PD. Clinical trials involving grafting of embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue in PD patients have provided proof-of-concept for the feasibility of cell therapy in this disease (Lindvall and Bjo ̈rklund, 2004). However, this approach is not widely applicable owing to the limited supply of such tissues and to ethical concerns. Human pluripotent stem cells, such as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomson et al., 1998), have great potential regarding their therapeutic use for PD patients (Lee et al., 2000; Ying et al., 2003; Nat et al., 2007; Morizane et al., 2008). More recently, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by ectopic expression of a defined set of factors (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007; Aasen et al., 2008; Lowry et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008b) has enabled the deri- vation of patient-specific pluripotent cells, providing valu- able experimental platforms to model human disease (Dimos et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008a; Ebert et al., 2009; Soldner et al., 2009; Agarwal et al., 2010) and opening the possibility of implementing patient-matched cell-therapy applications (Hanna et al., 2007; Wernig et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2009). In addition, the possibility of genetically engineering human pluripotent stem cells to express potentially therapeutic molecules or to manipulate their differentiation toward a specific phenotype, which, for example, could be used to increase survival, differentiation, migration, and function of their progeny, creates new opportunities for the develop- ment of restorative treatment for PD patients.
  \n
  \nThe use of hESC/iPSC-based strategies to treat or model PD, however, is currently hampered by the lack of efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into DA neurons with the appropriate char- acteristics of A9- subtype ventral midbrain neurons, the neuronal cell type lost to PD (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010). A deeper understanding of DA neuron differentiation, patterning, and specialization will surely facilitate the gen- eration of an optimal cell source for cell replacement therapy and disease modeling for PD. During embryo development, midbrain DA neurons originate in the most ventral region of the midbrain and are patterned by local induction through the activity of signaling molecules such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), and wingless (WNT) (for review, see Smidt and Burbach, 2007). As a result of this, a characteristic region-specific makeup of transcrip-
  \ntion factor expression is established in neural progenitors. Among them, the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (Lmx1a) is selectively expressed in the proliferating neural progenitors that give rise to ventral midbrain DA neurons in the mouse, and has been shown to play crucial roles in de- termining their fate (Andersson et al., 2006).
  \n
  \nMoreover, overexpression of Lmx1a in mouse embryonic stem cells greatly improved their differentiation toward ventral mid- brain DA neurons (Andersson et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2009; Friling et al., 2009), prompting the possibility of using LMX1A modulation
