\n# Abstract
\n
\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer great hope for in vitro modeling of Parkinson’s disease (PD), as well as for designing cell-replacement therapies. To realize these opportunities, there is an urgent need to develop efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of
\nhESC/iPSC into dopamine (DA) neurons with the specific characteristics of the cell
\npopulation lost to PD, i.e., A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons. Here we use
\nlentiviral vectors to drive the expression of LMX1A, which encodes a transcription
\nfactor critical for ventral midbrain identity, specifically in neural progenitor cells. We show that clonal lines of hESC engineered to contain one or two copies of this lentiviral vector retain long-term self- renewing ability and pluripotent differentiation capacity. Greater than 60% of all neurons generated from LMX1A-engineered hESC were ventral midbrain DA neurons of the A9 subtype, compared with *10% in green fluorescent protein–engineered controls, as judged by specific marker expression and functional analyses. Moreover, DA neuron precursors differentiated from LMX1A-engineered hESC were able to survive and differentiate when grafted into the brain of adult mice. Finally, we provide evidence that LMX1A overexpression similarly increases the yield of DA neuron differentiation from human iPSC. Taken together, our data show that stable genetic engineering of hESC/iPSC with lentiviral vectors driving controlled expression of LMX1A is an efficient way to generate enriched populations of human A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons, which should prove useful for modeling PD and may be helpful for designing future cell-replacement strategies.
\n
\n# Introduction
\n
\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is an incurable, chronically progressive condition characterized by the continuing degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons projecting from the midbrain substantia nigra to the basal ganglia striatum (Marsden, 1990). Current symptomatic therapies, consisting primarily of pharmacological DA replacement, compensate the movement deficit efficiently over a period of several years, but are ineffective in alleviating the loss of autonomic and cognitive abilities. Moreover, current treatments are met with late complications, which might be due, at least partially, to neurotoxicity of the drugs. The localized loss of a specialized neuronal cell popula- tion, paired with the urgent need for long-term treatment options, makes cell replacement therapy a promising approach to treat PD. Clinical trials involving grafting of embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue in PD patients have provided proof-of-concept for the feasibility of cell therapy in this disease (Lindvall and Bjo ̈rklund, 2004). However, this approach is not widely applicable owing to the limited supply of such tissues and to ethical concerns. Human pluripotent stem cells, such as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (Thomson et al., 1998), have great potential regarding their therapeutic use for PD patients (Lee et al., 2000; Ying et al., 2003; Nat et al., 2007; Morizane et al., 2008). More recently, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by ectopic expression of a defined set of factors (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007; Aasen et al., 2008; Lowry et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008b) has enabled the deri- vation of patient-specific pluripotent cells, providing valu- able experimental platforms to model human disease (Dimos et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008a; Ebert et al., 2009; Soldner et al., 2009; Agarwal et al., 2010) and opening the possibility of implementing patient-matched cell-therapy applications (Hanna et al., 2007; Wernig et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2009). In addition, the possibility of genetically engineering human pluripotent stem cells to express potentially therapeutic molecules or to manipulate their differentiation toward a specific phenotype, which, for example, could be used to increase survival, differentiation, migration, and function of their progeny, creates new opportunities for the develop- ment of restorative treatment for PD patients.
\n
\nThe use of hESC/iPSC-based strategies to treat or model PD, however, is currently hampered by the lack of efficient protocols for the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into DA neurons with the appropriate char- acteristics of A9- subtype ventral midbrain neurons, the neuronal cell type lost to PD (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010). A deeper understanding of DA neuron differentiation, patterning, and specialization will surely facilitate the gen- eration of an optimal cell source for cell replacement therapy and disease modeling for PD. During embryo development, midbrain DA neurons originate in the most ventral region of the midbrain and are patterned by local induction through the activity of signaling molecules such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), and wingless (WNT) (for review, see Smidt and Burbach, 2007). As a result of this, a characteristic region-specific makeup of transcrip-
\ntion factor expression is established in neural progenitors. Among them, the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (Lmx1a) is selectively expressed in the proliferating neural progenitors that give rise to ventral midbrain DA neurons in the mouse, and has been shown to play crucial roles in de- termining their fate (Andersson et al., 2006).
\n
\nMoreover, overexpression of Lmx1a in mouse embryonic stem cells greatly improved their differentiation toward ventral mid- brain DA neurons (Andersson et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2009; Friling et al., 2009), prompting the possibility of using LMX1A modulation to similarly direct the fate of hESC/ iPSC-derived neurons. In support of this possibility, LMX1A expression was found to be required for the midbrain DA neuron differentiation of hESC (Cai et al., 2009). In spite of these promising pieces of evidence, strategies for increasing DA neuron differentiation of human neural precursors or hESC by LMX1A overexpression have been met with limited success. Thus, transfection of LMX1A-expressing constructs in human neuroblastoma cell lines did not increase the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons (Cai et al., 2009). Similarly, retroviral overexpression of LMX1A in immortalized human midbrain progenitors only resulted in very marginal increases in DA neuron differentiation (Roy- bon et al., 2008).A possible caveat in previous attempts to overexpress LMX1A in human neural stem cells or hESC could be the low levels of transfection/transduction achieved in these notoriously hard-to-transfect cell lines. In this context, the use of lentiviral vectors (LVs) (Naldini et al., 1996), to obtain robust and sustained transgene expression in neural or pluripotent stem cells (Lois et al., 2002; Pfeifer et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2003; Consiglio et al., 2004),acquires particular relevance. Indeed, transduction of hESC-derived neural progenitors with LVs expressing LMX1A under the control of a constitutive phos- phoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter has been recently re- ported to promote the generation of ventral midbrain DA neurons (Friling et al., 2009).
\n
\nIn this study, we tested whether hESC/iPSC could be stably engineered using LVs so that they would overexpress LMX1A in neural progenitors when prompted to differentiate.
\n
\nWe show that hESC/iPSC engineered in this way maintain their normal growth characteristics and retain their pluripotent differentiation ability, as judged by in vitro differentiation and teratoma formation assays. Notably, the levels of LMX1A overexpression achieved in neural pro- genitors differentiated from engineered hESC/iPSC are sufficient to boost the generation of ventral midbrain DA neurons. Analyses of the phenotypic and physiological properties of these cells, as well as the ability of grafted cells to survive and integrate into the striatum of adult mouse brains, showed that LMX1A-induced DA neurons differen- tiated from hESC/iPSC are essentially similar to authentic ventral midbrain DA neurons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that LVs can be exploited to stably engineer hESC/iPSC for their directed differentiation toward specific DA neuron phenotypes, thus making it possible to develop new strategies for modeling and treating neurodegenerative diseases.

\n# Materials and Methods
\n
\n## Cell culture
\n
\nThe hESC lines (ES[2] and ES[4]) and the iPSC lines used in these studies have been previously described (Aasen et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2008, 2009). Human pluripotent stem cells were cultured on the top of irradiated (55 Gy) human fore- skin fibroblasts (CCD1112SK; ATCC), seeded at a density of 7 · 104 cells/cm2 on 10-cm cell culture dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin (Chemicon, Millipore, Temecula, CA). The hESC and hiPSC were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in hESC medium, consisting of KnockOut DMEM (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 0.5% human albumin (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 50 lM 2-mercap- toethanol (Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD), and 10ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Peprotech, Rock Hill, NJ). Medium was changed every day. Individual hESC and iPSC colonies were passed by mechanical dissociation using a 150-lm-diameter plastic pipette (The Stripper; Midatlantic Diagnostics, Mount Laurel, NJ) and replated every 5–7 days. Karyotyping was performed by incubating colonies for 30 min in 2 ll/ml Colcemid (Invitrogen) by the G banding method. Fifteen metaphases were analyzed for each line.
\n
\n## Plasmid construction, lentiviral production, and hESC and iPSC transduction
\n
\nLMX1A or green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was driven by the NESTIN enhancer (NesE) (1,852bp) and the basic herpes virus thymidine kinase (HSV tk)
\npromoter element (925 bp). This enhancer contains a sufficient cis-element that recapitulates endogenous NESTIN expression in the CNS (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997).
\nThe cassette containing the NesE, HSV tk promoter, and Lmx1a cDNA was cloned in the CSC.cPPT.hCMV.GFP.Wpre LV backbone previously described (Lie et al., 2005). High-titer vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)–pseudotyped LV stocks were produced in 293T cells by calcium phosphate–mediated transient transfection of the transfer vector pRRL-SIN-PPT-NesE-Lmx1a-ires-GFP- WPRE, the late generation packaging construct pMDL, and the VSV envelope–expressing construct pMD2.G, and puri- fied by ultracentrifugation as previously described (Con- siglio et al., 2004). Expression titers, determined using HeLa cells by FACS analysis, were 5 · 108 to 1 · 109 transducing units (TU)/ml with an average HIV-1 p24 concentration of 100 lg/ml. The same day of transduction, 2 · 105 hESC (passage 15) were infected in suspension at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP, LV.NES.GFP, or LV.PGK.GFP in the presence of 6lg/ml Polybrene (Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO). The day after transduction, the medium was changed and transduction efficiency was estimated by FACS analysis for GFP
\nexpression.
\n
\n## DA differentiation of hESC
\n
\nFor neural induction, embryoid bodies (EBs) were gener- ated from large colony fragments obtained by mechanical splitting with a finely drawn Pasteur pipette and
\ncultured in nonadherent dishes for 3–4 days in the presence of hES medium. At Stage 2, EBs were cultured 10 days in suspen- sion in N2B27 medium consisting of DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen), Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), 0.5 · B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5· N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 2mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). In this stage, N2B27 medium was supple- mented with 10ng/ml bFGF, 100ng/ml FGF8 (Peprotech), and 100 ng/ml SHH (Invitrogen). Finally, at Stage 3 for DA neuron maturation, the neural precursors cells (NPCs) were cocultured with PA6 for 3 weeks in N2B27 medium sup- plemented with FGF8 and SHH.
\n
\n## In vitro differentiation toward the embryonic germ layers
\n
\nDifferentiation toward endoderm, mesoderm, and neu- roectoderm was carried out essentially as described (Raya et al., 2010).Teratoma formation in nude mice
\nSevere combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used to test the teratoma induction capacity of hES-LMX1A cells essentially as described (Raya et al., 2008). All animal experiments were conducted following experimental protocols previously ap- proved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals, in full compliance with Spanish and European laws and regulations. In brief, *1–3 · 106 hES- LMX1A cells were injected subcutaneously into the testis of SCID mice anesthetized with isoflurane. Five to 8 weeks after injection, teratomas were dissected, fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin phosphate, and embedded in paraffin.
\n
\n## RT-PCR analysis
\n
\nTotal mRNA was isolated by guanidinium thiocynate– phenol–chloroform extraction (TRIzol; Invitrogen) and trea- ted with DNase I. One microgram was used to synthesize cDNA by using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was done in triplicate on 50ng by using Platinum SYBER Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) in an ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). All results were nor- malized to the average expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and B-2-MICROGLOBULIN. Results were obtained from three or four technical replicates of three or four independent biological samples at each data point. Transcript-specific primers used were as follows: B2M, 5’-GCCGTGTGAACCATGTGACT-3’ and 5’-GCTTACATGT CTCGATCCCACTT-3’; HPRT,5’-TATGGACAGGACTGAACGTCTTG-3’ and 5’-GCACACAGAGGGCTACAATGTG- 3’; LMX1A, 5’-AGGAAGGCAAGGACCATAAGC-3’ and 5’- ATGCTCGCCTCTGTTGAGTTG- 3’; PAX6, 5’-GCTTCAC CATGGCAAATAACC-3’ and 5’-GGCAGCATGCAGGAG TATGA-3’; SOX1, 5’-TACGT TTATTTCAGCAGCCTTAGG- 3’ and 5’-TCCAGGACAAGGAAGGGTGTT-3’; NURR1, 5’- CGCCTGTAACTCGGCTGAAG-3’ and 5’-CTTGAGGCGAGGACCCATAC-3’; ALDH1A1, 5’-TGACAAGATCCAGGGCCGTACAAT-3’ and 5’-TGAGAGGAGTTTGCTCTGCTGGTT-3’; EN1, 5’-CAGACCCATAATCCTGCATTTCTC-3’ and 5’-TTTGGGATGTAGGCAAATGGA-3’; OCT4, 5’-GGA GGAAGCTGACAACAATGAAA-3’ and 5’-GGCCTGCACGAGGGTTT-3’; NANOG, 5’-ACAACTGGCCGAAGAATA GCA-3’ and 5’-GGTTCCCAGTCGGGTTCAC-3’; TH, 5’-CCGAGCTGTGAAGGTGTTTGA-3’ and 5’-CGGGCCGGGTC TCTAGAT-3’; IRES, 5’-TGTGAGGGCCCGGAAAC-3’ and 5’-GGGAAAGACCCCTAGGAATGC-3’; UTR, 5’-CCTTGG CTCTTCCTTCCAACT-3’ and 5’-ATGGCTGCTGGGTCTTC TGT-3’.
\n
\n## DNA extraction, Southern, and integration analysis
\n
\nDNA isolation was performed with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Southern analysis, the genomic DNA was digested overnight with 40U of PstI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a neutral nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham, GE Healthcare Limited, Buckingham- Shire) by capillary transfer, and hybridized with a GFP di- goxigenin (DIG)–2’-deoxyuridine 5’-triphosphate–labeled probe generated by PCR using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The probe was detected by an alkaline phosphatase–conjugated DIG-Antibody (Roche Diagnostics) using CDP-Star (Sigma- Aldrich) as a substrate for chemiluminescence. The GFP probe was generated using an eGFP template with the primers GFP-F 5’- CGCACCATCTT CTTCAAGGAC-3’ and GFP-R 5’-CATGCCGAGAGTGATC CCG-3’. Quantification of transgene copy number per cell was analyzed by qPCR using Platinum SYBER Green qPCR Su- perMix (Invitrogen) in an ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). To determine the number of integrations, primers specific for the transgene sequence were generated: IRES-F, 5’-TGTGAGGGCCCGGAAAC-3’ and IRES-R 5’-GGGAAAGACCCC TAGGAATGC-3’. To quantify the number of cells, B-ACTIN primers were used: B-ACTIN-F 5’-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3’ and B-ACTIN-R 5’-ACA GTCTCCACTCACCC AG GA-3’. To measure the average proviral DNA per transduced cell, two standard curves were made: one employing a known amount of the LV (LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP) using the IRES primers, and a second curve employing a known number of cells and the B-ACTIN primers. Next, the average proviral number per cell was estimated by interpo- lation of the IRES-to-B-ACTIN ratio from each DNA sample in the two standard curves.
\n
\n## Immunochemistry and cell counts
\n
\nhESC and iPSC were grown on plastic cover-slide chambers for immunostaining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformalde- hyde and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris- buffered saline. Cells were then blocked in 0.5% Triton X-100 with 3% donkey serum for 2 hr before incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Tra-1-60 (Chemicon; 1:100), mouse anti-Tra-1-81 (Chemicon; 1:100), rabbit anti-Sox2 (Chemicon; 1:500), rabbit anti-GAD (Chemicon; 1:1,000), mouse anti-HNA (Chemicon; 1:200), rabbit anti-calbindin (Chemicon; 1:1,000), rabbit anti- Nestin (Chemicon;1:200), rat anti-DAT ( Millipore; 1:400, Hudson, WI), mouse anti-SSEA-4 (MC-813-70, 1:2), and mouse anti-SSEA-3 (MC-631, 1:2) (from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), rabbit anti-TH (Sigma; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-
\nGirk2 (Sigma; 1:40), mouse anti- ACTA1 (Sigma; 1:400), mouse anti-SMA (Sigma;
\n1:400), rabbit anti-a-fetoprotein (1:400), rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako; 1:1,000, Dako, Denmark), mouse anti-Tuj1, (Covance; 1:500, Emery- ville, California), mouse anti-Oct-3/4 (Santa Cruz; 1:100), rabbit anti-Gata4 (Santa Cruz; 1:50), goat anti-Nanog (Everest Biotech; 1:100, Oxford-Shire, UK), goat anti-FoxA2 (R&D Biosystems; 1:100), chicken anti-GFP (AveLabs; 1:200), rabbit anti-5-HT (Immunostar; 1:2,000), mouse anti-synaptophysin (Millipore; 1:500, Hudson, WI), rabbit anti-DBH (Chemicon; 1:200), and rabbit anti-Lmx1a (kindly provided by Dr. M.S. German, University of California, San Francisco Diabetes Center). Secondary antibodies used were all the Alexa Fluor Series from Invitrogen (all 1:500). Images were taken using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. For quantification of stained cells, 300 cells per differentiated aggregate were randomly counted (average six to eight differentiated aggregates per experiment). Data points represent the average of at least three independent experiments.
\n
\n## Transplantation in immunodeficient mice
\n
\nTwenty 6-week-old SCID beige mice were anesthetized and stereotaxically injected with 2· 105 cells at Stage 3 in 2 ll using a Hamilton syringe in the striatum. The cells were injected at 1 ll/min rate. Mice were sacrificed at 1 month (n = 11) and 5 months (n = 8) after transplantation. Upon sacrifice, animals were perfused transcardially with paraformaldehyde (4%), and the brains sectioned at 20lm on a freezing microtome and stained with antibodies as previously described. Brain sections were analyzed for the presence of immunoreactive cells along the entire length of the graft. All animal experiments were conducted following experimental protocols previously approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals, in full compliance with Spanish and European laws and regulations.
\n
\n## DA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
\n
\nLevels of DA were quantified using an ELISA kit obtained from Rocky Mountain Diagnostics (Colorado Springs, CO; http://www.rmdiagnostics.com) according to the
\nmanufacturer’s instructions. In brief, after being rinsed in a low-KCl (4.7 mM) solution, the cells were incubated in 1 ml of a high- KCl (60mM) solution for 15min at 37°C. After stimulation with high potassium, DA was measured by ELISA analysis, as previously described (Trzaska et al., 2007).
\n
\n##  Electrophysiology recordings
\n
\nElectrophysiology studies were performed using E2 Technology (Aleria Biodevices, Barcelona, Spain). In brief, the cells are cultured in a plate composed of pairs of wells connected through a 1-mm-long microchannel, cells are seeded in the wells, and axons sprout all along the micro- channel. For recording, one electrode is located in each well. NPCs were seeded in the wells on the top of PA6; 3 weeks later, recordings in loose patch mode were obtained (Mor- ales et al., 2008).

\n## In vitro differentiation of DA neurons from hESC/iPSC
\n
\nIn a first series of experiments, we used the ES[4] hESC line previously derived in ourlaboratory (Raya et al. 2008), maintained by mechanical passaging on top of feeder layers of irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. To promote DA neuron differentiation, we implemented a three-stage pro- tocol involving (1) hESC aggregation (via EB formation), (2) neural induction, and (3) DA neuron maturation using a PA6 feeder-based system (Kawasaki et al., 2002) (Fig. 1a). Speci- fically, neural induction was carried out by incubating EBs in suspension for 10 days in a defined medium supplemented with FGF2, SHH, and FGF8 (Ying et al., 2003; Roy et al., 2006) (Fig. 1b). After that, in Stage 2, NPCs positive for early neural markers, such as NESTIN and SOX2, started to become ap-
\nparent in the dish (Fig. 1c and d). To achieve DA neuron maturation, NPCs were then treated in Stage 3 with FGF8/ SHH and plated on top of PA6 cells. At this stage and under these conditions, almost 50% of the cells expressed the neu- ronal marker TUJ1, of which *50% were of DA lineage as judged by TH expression (Fig. 1e). In our hands, differentiation of hESC in monolayer (e.g., without EB formation) or in the absence of PA6 coculture resulted in poor DA neuron yield ( < 10% of the differentiated cells were neurons, of which < 25% were DA neurons; Fig. 1f ). Similarly, supplementation with FGF2 during the entire differentiation pro- tocol resulted in fewer neurons and DA neurons compared with conditions where FGF2 was withdrawn during Stage 3 (Fig. 1f).
\n
\nAs expected, the expression of SSEA-3 and TRA-1-81, markers of undifferentiated hESC, dramatically declined during the differentiation process, so that only 0.1% of the cells expressed both markers at the end of the protocol, as judged by flow cytometry (Fig. 1g). We confirmed these results by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses of OCT4 expression, which also showed a marked decrease as dif- ferentiation proceeded (Fig. 1h). To test whether our differentiation could be applied to other lines of human pluripotent stem cells with comparable results, we subjected an additional hESC line {ES[2] (Raya et al., 2008)} and two independent lines of iPSC [KiPS4F#1 and cFA404FiPS4F#1 (Aasen et al., 2008; Raya et al., 2009, respectively)] to the same protocol and harvested samples at different time points for analyses of gene expression. The behavior of all four hESC/ iPSC lines was similar in terms of the decrease in OCT4 ex- pression and the up-regulation of neural and neuronal markers (Fig. 1h). Specifically, markers of neural precursors such as PAX6 and SOX1 were found up-regulated in all cell lines tested, peaking at the end of Stage 2 or the first week of Stage 3, whereas markers of DA neuron phenotype such as TH peaked at later time points. The expression of LMX1A, encoding a key transcription factor for midbrain identity (Andersson et al., 2006), showed an intermediate profile, with maximum levels reached between weeks 2 and 3 of Stage 3 (Fig. 1i–l). These results show that we have optimized a protocol for DA neuron differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells that is applicable to both hESC and iPSC, and that achieves DA neuron
\ndifferentiation efficiencies in the range of previously published protocols (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010). However, and also in agreement with previous reports (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010), DA neurons generated with our protocol were not the majority of the specific subtype lost in PD (i.e., A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons), as judged by the expression of G protein–activated inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK2; encoded by potassium channel, inwardly rectifying, subfamily j, member 6; KCNJ6) (Inanobe et al., 1999; Mendez et al., 2005) (see below).
\n
\n## Achieving neural-specific overexpression of LMX1A
\n
\nTherefore, we next asked whether delivering the ventral midbrain DA lineage-associated transcription LMX1A to human pluripotent stem cells could provide appropriate regionalization cues during their differentiation. For this pur- pose, we generated an LV
\n(LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP; Fig. 2a) in which LMX1A expression is driven by a neural NESTIN enhancer, active in neural progenitor cells (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997) and a minimal TK promoter. The vector also expressed GFP downstream of an IRES element, to allow monitoring of the transgenic expression of LMX1A during the differentiation process. After transduction of hESC with this LV at an MOI of 50, GFP expression was not observed in undifferentiated hESC, whereas it could be clearly detected by epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry during the early steps of neural differentiation (Fig. 2b and c). In contrast, >90% of hESC transduced in parallel with LVs expressing GFP from a constitutive PGK promoter (LV.PGK.GFP) displayed strong GFP expression in both the undifferentiated state and during neural differentiation (Fig. 2b and c). The specificity of the LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP con- struct in hESC undergoing neural differentiation was further confirmed by testing coimmunolocalization of GFP and NESTIN (Fig. 2d). To investigate the effect of LMX1A overexpression during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, we sub- jected hESC tranduced with LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP to our three-stage DA neuron differentiation protocol, and com- pared the overall yield of neurons and DA neurons with those of hESC transduced with a control (LV.NES.GFP) virus. Whereas no overt differences were found in the total number of neurons in each condition at the end of Stage 3, hESC overexpressing LMX1A generated a significantly higher proportion of DA neurons (Fig. 2e). However, the increased DA neuron differentiation of LV.NES.LM- X1A.GFP transduced hESC was progressively lost as cells were passaged (Fig. 2e), concomitant with a decrease in the levels of transgenic LMX1A overexpression (Fig. 2f), sug- gesting silencing of the LV transgenes and/or selection of untransduced hESC upon passaging.
\n
\n## Generation of hESC clones overexpressing LMX1A
\n
\nTo circumvent the loss of LMX1A expression in bulk- transduced hESC, we set out to generate clonal lines of LV.NES.LMX1A.GFP-transduced hESC (hES-LMX1A cells). As controls, stable cell lines transduced with LV.NES.GFP were generated (mock-hESC). In order to obtain hESC colo- nies derived from single cells, 5 days after infection (MOI 10) cells were trypsinized to single cells and serial dilutions plated on human feeder fibroblasts in six-well plates. Be- tween 3 and 6 weeks after plating, colonies of tightly packed cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and hESC-like morphology appeared in those cultures. We picked and ex- panded nine independent colonies from wells in which only two to four colonies had grown. The number of lentiviral integration(s) in each clonal line were first screened by qPCR on genomic DNA using primers specific to the IRES se- quence and normalized for b-actin (see Materials and Methods for details). From the nine clones analyzed, five of them (clones A, C, G, H, and K) showed no lentiviral inte- grations, three of them (clones B, L, and I) contained a single lentiviral integration, and one (clone D) showed two inte- grations. The accuracy of this PCR-based screen was con- firmed in selected clones by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 3a). We selected clones D and L of transgenic hES-LMX1A cells for a thorough characterization and first tested whether the LV transduction could support undifferentiated hESC culture for extended periods of time. After 32 passages, or 8 months in continuous culture, transgenic hES-LMX1A cells maintained a normal 46-XY karyotype (Fig. 3b and data not shown) and remained undifferentiated and pluripotent, as judged by the expression of pluripotency-associated markers OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, and surface markers SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-81 (Fig. 3c–e and data not shown), and the ability to differentiate in vitro into derivatives of the three main embryonic germ layers (Fig. 3f–h and data not shown). In addition, injection of clone D hESC into immunocom- promised mice resulted in complex teratomas containing derivatives from all three germ layers, further confirming that transgenic hES-LMX1A cells were pluripotent (Fig. 3i– k). Overall, these results show that genetic manipulation of hESC with LVs expressing LMX1A under the control of a neural NESTIN enhancer does not cause any conspicuous deleterious effect in their self-renewing or pluripotent differentiation abilities.

\n## Effect of neural-specific overexpression of LMX1A on DA neuron differentiation
\n
\nTransgenic clones of hES-LMX1A cells showed a robust overexpression of LMX1A under DA neuron differentiation conditions, reaching levels of up to 10-fold higher than those of mock-hESC (Fig. 4a). During the course of DA neuron differentiation, both hES-LMX1A and mock-hESC showed a progressive decline in the expression of pluripotency- associated genes such as NANOG, until levels were barely detectable (Fig. 4b). However, the increase in the expression of genes associated with DA neuron differentiation, such as nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group a, member 2 [NR4A2, en- coding nuclear receptor-related 1 (NURR1)], engrailed 1 (EN1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1), and TH, was significantly more pronounced in hES-LMX1A cells when compared with mock-hESC (Fig. 4c–f),suggesting that more cells were being specified to a DA neuron lineage. We directly addressed this possibility by analyzing the expression of relevant markers (Isacson et al., 2003) at various time points of the differentiation protocol by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4g–p). As expected, more LMX1A-positive cells were found in differentiating hES-LMX1A cells in comparison with mock-hESC at Stage 2 (Fig. 4g and h). Moreover, at the end of Stage 3, hES-LMX1A cells generated > 25% more DA neurons than mock-hESC (Fig. 4i and j), as evaluated by quantifying the number of TH/TUJ1 double-positive cells (Fig. 4q). Importantly, the majority of DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A cells, but not from mock-hESC, presented the typical bipolar morphology of mDA neurons, stained positive for FOXA2, coexpressed the A9-subtype marker GIRK2, and were mature, as judged by coexpression of DA transporter (DAT) (Fig. 4k–p). In contrast, DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A cells did not express the A10-subtype markercalbindin, although some calbindin- expressing neurons were observed, whereas this marker was frequently coexpressed in mock-hESC-derived DA neurons (Fig. 4r and s).DA neurons differentiated from either hES- LMX1A cells or mock-hESC did not express the marker of adrenergic neurons dopamine-b-hydroxylase (DBH, Fig. 4t and u), or serotonin (5-HT), marker of serotonergic neurons (Fig. 4v and w). Functional characterization of DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A cells We next tested whether DA neurons allowed to differ- entiate fully in vitro (end of Stage 3) displayed the func- tional characteristics expected from bona fide DA neurons. For this purpose, we analyzed their ability to release DA in response to appropriate stimuli. Cells differentiated from either hES-LMX1A or mock-hESC (but not undifferentiated cells) showed robust DA release induced by a depolarizing solution of KCl (60 mM; see Fig. 4x). Next, we analyzed the electrophysiological properties of DA neurons through extracellular recordings using the E2 Technology, in which 10–50 axons grow within a
\nmicrochannel and allow si- multaneous recording of multiple neurons (Morales et al.,2008). These studies showed that cells differentiated from either hES-LMX1A or mock- hESC, but not undifferentiated cells, fired spontaneous action potentials, providing evidence that these cells are, indeed, functional neurons. Moreover, cells differentiated from hES-LMX1A, but not from mock-hESC, responded to the application of DA with a marked reduction in spontaneous firing activity (Fig. 4y), a behavior characteristic of midbrain DA neurons (Friling et al., 2009). Taken together, our results so far show that clones of hESC engineered to overexpress LMX1A in neural precursors, when subject to our optimized protocol for DA neuron differentiation, efficiently generate DA neurons that are molecularly and functionally of the ventral midbrain A9 subtype. To investigate the functional properties of DA neurons differentiated from hES-LMX1A and mock-hESC, we first tested their ability to engraft and survive within the context of the adult brain. For this purpose, we transplanted 2 · 105 differentiating hESC at mid-Stage 3 (after 2 weeks of cocul- ture with PA6 cells) directly into the striatum of unlesioned mice.One month after transplantation, grafted cells identi- fied by GFP expression (Fig. 5a),immunofluorescence against TUJ1/TH (Fig. 5b), and antibodies against human nuclear antigen (HNA) (Fig. 5c) were found at the expected position in 10 of 11 mice. To analyze longer grafting times, we retained four mice injected with mock-hESC and four mice injected with hES-LMX1A cells for an additional 4 months. In all eight animals, we found viable grafts con- taining human TH-positive cells (Fig. 5d–f), although their numbers were much higher in those injected with hES- LMX1A cells (compare Fig. 5e and f).Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the vast majority of TH positive cells found in the engrafted hES- LMX1A cells 5 months after transplantation were mature A9-subtype DA neurons, as shown by coexpression of GIRK2 and DAT (Fig. 5g). Consistentwith this, we did not detect GABAergic or serotonergic neurons in the grafted area (Fig.5h and i).
\n
\n# Discussion
\n
\nOne of the major bottlenecks to the development of hESC/ iPSC-based strategies for modeling and treating human disease is the relative lack of efficient directed differentiation protocols for generating the specific cell type(s) relevant to the disease. In the case of PD, a variety of protocols have been described that promote the differentiation of hESC/ iPSC toward DA neurons (for review, see Hwang et al., 2010), but in most cases these were not appropriately patterned as A9-subtype ventral midbrain DA neurons, the relevant cell type for PD. Forcing the expression of patterning- and/or fate- associated transcription factors may help overcome this limitation, as evidenced by studies in which Lmx1a (An- dersson et al., 2006; Friling et al., 2009) or a combination of Nurr1 and Pitx3 (Martinat et al., 2006) or Nurr1 and Foxa2 (Lee et al., 2010) was overexpressed in mouse neural pre- cursor cells. Here, we decided to focus on LMX1A, because it was the only transcription factor the overexpression of which had been shown to clearly increase the percentage of ventral midbrain DA neurons differentiated from human neural progenitors (Friling et al., 2009). In this latter work, hESC- derived neural progenitors were transduced with LVs ex- pressing Lmx1a under a constitutive PGK promoter. Building on these data, we decided to exploit the ability of LVs to provide long-term and robust transgene expression in plu- ripotent stem cells and neural progenitors (Lois et al., 2002; Pfeifer et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2003; Consiglio et al., 2004), as well as the selectivity of expression in neural progenitor cells conferred by the neural NESTIN enhancer (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997; Andersson et al., 2006), to address whether: (1) human pluripotent stem cells can be stably engineered to express LMX1A while maintaining their characteristic self- renewal and pluripotent differentiation abilities; and (2) ex- pression of LMX1A in the context of engineered hESC/iPSC is sufficient to direct the fate of differentiating neural progenitors toward ventral midbrain DA neurons of the A9 subtype.
\n
\nOn the first issue, our results show that clonal lines of hESC containing one or two copies of the integrated LMX1A- expressing LVs retain the typical features of nonmanipulated hESC, including colony morphology and growth character- istics, long-term self-renewing ability while maintaining a stable karyotype, expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and surface markers, in vitro differenti- ation into derivatives of the three main embryo germ layers, and teratoma formation ability (Fig. 3). This is particularly important because, even though we confirmed the specificity of expression of the neural NESTIN enhancer in neural progenitors (Fig. 2), there was measurable expression of trans- genic LMX1A in undifferentiated hESC (Fig. 4a), probably owing to leakage of our system. Therefore, it is important to note that the somewhat higher levels of LMX1A expression in undifferentiated hES-LMX1A cells, compared with mock- hESC, do not appear to be detrimental for their maintenance as undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells, even upon long- term passaging.
\n
\nHowever, when induced to differentiate toward neuronal fates, hES-LMX1A cells generated significantly higher num- bers of DA neurons than mock-hESC (*40% more, based on TH/TUJ1 double staining) and, more importantly, most of these DA neurons were of the ventral midbrain A9 subtype (up to 75% of them, compared with *25% in the case of mock-hESC, based on colabeling of TH and GIRK2). Con- sequently, of 100 hES-LMX1A cells, we obtained >30 A9- subtype DA neurons, versus approximately seven from mock-hESC, that is, close to a fivefold increase in the overall yield of the differentiation procedure. These differences are consistent with more differentiating cells being recruited into the ventral midbrain DA neuron lineage as transgenic LMX1A begins to be expressed in neural precursors, as evi- denced by the increased numbers of LMX1A-positive cells in Stage 2 of differentiation.
\n
\nOur results show that, under ventralizing conditions such as exposure to SHH, LMX1A is sufficient to direct the dif- ferentiation of human neural progenitors toward ventral midbrain DA neurons. This is in agreement with previous studies in the mouse, conducted by the Ericson laboratory (Andersson et al., 2006; Friling et al., 2009), and also in human cells (Friling et al., 2009). Therefore, the reported failure of other groups to induce human DA neuron differentiation by overexpressing LMX1A (Roybon et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2009) is likely the result of inadequate levels of expression of this factor, due either to low transfection efficiency (Cai et al., 2009) or to strong overexpression driven by retroviruses (Roybon et al., 2008). In this regard, it is important to note that the levels of LMX1A expression achieved in our clonal hES-LMX1A cell lines harboring one or two LV integrations are in the same range of endogenous LMX1A expression levels during DA differentiation. Thus, LMX1A expression in hES-LMX1A cells, at its peak in mid-Stage 3, is roughly only three times higher than that of mock-hESC (Fig. 4a). Taking into account that, as discussed above, the number of cells undergoing A9 DA neuron differentiation is about five times higher in hES-LMX1A cells than in mock-hESC, it follows that the levels of LMX1A expression per cell should be within the same order of magnitude in either case.
\n
\nOur results also show that hES-LMX1A cells committed to DA lineages in vitro are able to complete differentiation to A9 ventral midbrain DA neurons upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. We transplanted differentiating cells at mid-Stage 3 (after 2 weeks of coculture with PA6 cells), because we surmised that cells at this stage of differentiation, at which they express high levels of NURR1, EN1, ALDH1A1, and TH (see Fig. 4c–f), would have become depleted of undifferentiated progenitors but were not yet fully differentiated, thus making them more likely to survive after grafting. Indeed, viable grafted cells were recovered 5 months after transplantation and shown to have completed differentiation in situ. Conversely, mock-hESC pre- treated in vitro under the same conditions and transplanted into adult mouse brains differentiated very poorly in vivo, in agreement with previous reports that highlighted the inability of adult brain tissue to direct transplanted human neural progenitors to acquire the DA neuron fate (Ben-Hur et al., 2004). Therefore, in the absence of appropriate environmental cues, transgenic LMX1A expression appears to maintain a ventral midbrain DA neuron differentiation program in hES-LMX1A cells.
\n
\nOur strategy of LV-mediated engineering of human plu- ripotent stem cells to overexpress LMX1A in neural pro- genitors provides an efficient way to generate enriched populations of neurons with the characteristics of A9 ventral midbrain DA neurons. As this strategy is applicable to both hESC and iPSC, it should be suitable for modeling PD pathogenesis in vitro, as well as worth considering when designing future cell-therapy applications for this disease.

\n(a) Schematic representation of the different stages for the in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells toward DA neurons. At Stage 1, EBs are formed by aggregation. At Stage 2, NPCs are obtained culturing the EBs in suspension with N2B27 medium supplemented with FGF2, FGF8, and SHH. At Stage 3, NPCs are cocultured with PA6 for 3 weeks and DA neurons are generated. (b) NPCs formed at Stage 2 express the neural precursor markers NESTIN (c) and SOX2 (d). (e) At Stage 3, some of the TUJ1-positive cells generated coexpress TH. (f) Omitting the EB generation step or the coculture with PA6 cells results in < 10% of the cells differentiating to neurons, of which *24% are TH- positive. Better results are obtained with the addition of FGF2 during the coculture with PA6; the number of neurons generated is 14% and 40% of the neurons stained for TH. With the three stage protocol implemented in (a), the yield of neurons generated increases to 48% and the TH-positive neurons to 50%. (g) Flow cytometry analysis shows that, in the undifferentiated state, 90% of the cells are positive for TRA-1-81 or SSEA-3. This value is reduced to 38% in NPCs and to 10% at the first week in coculture with PA6. At 3 weeks in coculture with PA6, 99% of the cells are double negative, thus indicating that mainly all of the cells have entered into the differentiation process. (h) A decrease or inactivation of the expression of the pluripotency marker OCT4 is found as the differentiation occurs. (i, j) The neural precursor markers PAX6 and SOX1 show activation in NPCs, and the expression starts to decay at 3 weeks in coculture with PA6. (k) The DA progenitor marker LMX1A starts to be expressed in NPCs, but reaches the maximum level of expression during coculture with PA6. (l) TH levels of expression are first detected in NPCs, and its expression is maintained or grows until the end of the protocol. *p < 0.05. Scale bar = 50 lm. In all experiments, n = 3.

Relative levels of expression of the pluripotency marker NANOG (b) are similar in both lines. Higher levels of NURR1 (c), EN1 (d), ALDH1A1 (e), and TH (f ) are observed in hES-LMX1A compared with mock-hESC. (g–w) hESC are differentiated and analyzed at different stages of the DA protocol. (g, h) Staining for LMX1A at Stage 2 is more prominent in hES-LMX1A than in mock-hESC. Staining at the end of the protocol for TH and TUJ1 (i, j), TH and GIRK2 (k, l), and TH and DAT (m, n), show a higher number of TH-, GIRK2-, and DAT-positive neurons in hES- LMX1A as compared with mock-hES. Only hES-LMX1A in Stage 3 present TH-positive neurons with staining of FOXA2 in the nucleus, a feature typical of mDA neurons but not mock-hES (o, p). (q) Quantification of TUJ1, TH, and GIRK2 expression at the end of the protocol. The expression of TUJ1 is *55% in both infected lines. Approximately 55% of mock-hESC TUJ1-positive cells expressed TH, and this amount increased to 80% in hES-LMX1A. The expression of GIRK2, a midbrain DA neuron marker, is restricted to 20% of the cells from mock-hESC and present in the majority of TH-positive neurons from hES-LMX1A. (r–w) Analyses for other neuronal subtypes within the culture at the end of the protocol. (r) Some TH-positive neurons are positive for calbindin in mock-hES, indicating that they are A10 neurons.

\nThe progressive loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is a distinguishing feature of Parkinson’s disease. As terminal field loss seems to precede cell body loss, we tested whether alterations of axonal transport motor proteins would be early features in
\nParkinson’s disease. There was a decline in axonal transport motor proteins in sporadic Parkinson’s disease that preceded other well-known nigral cell-related pathology such as phenotypic downregulation of dopamine. Reductions in conventional kinesin levels precede the alterations in dopaminergic phenotypic markers (tyrosine hydroxylase) in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. This reduction was significantly greater in nigral neurons containing a-synuclein inclusions. Unlike conventional kinesin, reductions in the levels of the cytoplasmic dynein light chain Tctex type 3 subunit were only observed at late Parkinson’s disease stages. Reductions in levels of conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein subunits were recapitulated in a rat genetic Parkinson’s disease model based on over-expression of human mutant a-synuclein (A30P). Together, our data
\nsuggest that a-synuclein aggregation is a key feature associated with reductions of axonal transport motor proteins in Parkinson’s disease and support the hypothesis that dopaminergic neurodegeneration following a ‘dying-back’ pattern involving
\naxonal transport disruption.

\n# Introduction
\nDisruptions in axonal transport represent early pathogenic features
\nin neurodegeneration and may cause disease progression in a
\nnumber of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease
\n(Roy et al., 2005; Morfini et al., 2009). Accordingly, pathological
\nstudies identified axonal enlargements and aberrant
\naccumulations of organelle cargos in Parkinson’s disease brains
\n(Chung et al., 2009). Further, nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons
\naffected in Parkinson’s disease follow a ‘dying back’ pattern of
\ndegeneration that is consistent with alteration in axonal transport
\n(Iseki et al., 2001; Raff et al., 2002; Morfini et al., 2009).
\nalpha-synuclein (-synuclein) is a synaptic protein of unknown
\nfunction that mainly localizes to termini (Lykkebo and Jensen, 2002) and
\naccumulates in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites characteristic
\nof cases with idiopathic, sporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\nSignificantly, several mutations in -synuclein, as well as increased
\ngenetic doses of -synuclein, lead to familial forms of Parkinson’s
\ndisease, suggesting a critical role of -synuclein in sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease pathogenesis (Dauer and Przedborski, 2003).
\nIt is assumed that -synuclein modulates various physiological
\nfunctions in the presynaptic compartment, such as regulating
\nthe activity of the dopamine transporter or fine-tuning neurotransmitter
\nrelease (Madine et al., 2006). Experimental evidence
\nsuggests that both mutations and over-expression of
\n-synuclein might lead to axonal transport defects. For example,
\nviral over-expression of mutant A53T -synuclein in rats induced
\ndystrophic axons and alterations in axonal transport that
\npreceded neuronal loss (Chung et al., 2009). Also, mild
\nover-expression of -synuclein in cultured hippocampal neurons
\npromotes reductions in the levels of synaptic proteins at
\npresynaptic terminals, a phenomenon termed ‘vacant synapses’
\n(Scott et al., 2010). These and other studies linked alterations in
\naxonal transport to familial Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis,
\nbut the relevance of these findings to sporadic Parkinson’s disease
\nremains unknown.
\nOur recent studies indicate that accumulation of perikaryal
\n-synuclein aggregates in sporadic Parkinson’s disease and familial
\nParkinson’s disease models is associated with a loss of dopamine
\nphenotype (Chu et al., 2006), as well as disruptions in both lysosomal
\nand proteosomal functions (Chu et al., 2009). Accumulation
\nand aggregation of -synuclein also correlates with reduced levels
\nof myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a protein that plays an
\nimportant role in synapse formation and maintenance (Flavell
\net al., 2006, 2008; Chu et al., 2011).
\nWhether disease-associated -synuclein inclusions are associated
\nwith axonal transport alterations needs to be investigated in the
\nParkinson’s disease brain. To evaluate this possibility, our study
\ndetermined the relative levels of critical motor protein subunits
\nin early and late Parkinson’s disease, compared with age-matched
\ncontrols. Immunohistochemical analysis helped establish (i)
\nwhether axonal transport proteins are altered in remaining
\nneuromelanin-laden nigral neurons; (ii) whether reductions in
\naxonal transport proteins precede and exceed reductions in dopaminergic
\nmarkers and (iii) whether reductions of axonal transport
\nproteins are associated with -synuclein inclusion formation in
\nnigral neurons. In addition, we also over-expressed -synuclein
\nin the rodent substantia nigra and performed similar assessments
\nin this rodent model of Parkinson’s disease. Results from these
\nstudies suggest that abnormalities in axonal transport motor proteins
\nrepresent an early degenerative event in both familial and
\nsporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\n
\n# Materials and methods
\n## Human tissue acquisition and processing
\nTo first establish the quality of the human tissue (both control and
\nParkinson’s disease), we immunostained sections from each case using
\na monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody that consistently
\nyields well-established immunostaining patterns in hypothalamus.
\nCases in which brain tissue demonstrated weak tyrosine hydroxylase
\nimmunoreactivity in hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons in arcuate
\nnucleus and periventricular nucleus were excluded from the study.
\nWe analysed tissues from 25 subjects with clinical and neuropathological
\ndiagnoses of Parkinson’s disease (n = 16) and age-matched
\ncontrols (n = 9). According to Hoehn and Yahr (1967; OFF medication)
\nscores, cases with Parkinson’s disease were divided into early
\n(Hoehn and Yahr 1–2; n = 6) and late Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn
\nand Yahr 3–5; n = 10) stages. There were no differences in age at
\nthe time of death (P40.05) or post-mortem interval (P40.05)
\namong the three groups examined (Table 1). All patients with
\nParkinson’s disease were diagnosed by movement disorder specialists
\nin the Section of Movement Disorders in the Department of
\nNeurological Sciences at Rush University Medical Centre.
\nPost-mortem, a board-certified neuropathologist at Rush University
\nMedical Centre confirmed the clinical diagnosis. For Parkinson’s disease,
\ninclusion criteria included a history compatible with idiopathic
\nParkinson’s disease and at least two of the four cardinal motor signs
\n(rest tremor, rigidity, akinesia/bradykinesia and gait disturbance/postural
\nreflex impairment). The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
\n3 (UPDRS3 ON and OFF medication) and Hoehn and Yahr (ON and
\nOFF medication) were recorded. The pathological diagnosis was based
\non finding Lewy bodies in catecholamine nuclei such as the substantia
\nnigra. Exclusion criteria included familial Parkinson’s disease, the Lewy
\nbody variant of Alzheimer’s disease or the combination of Parkinson’s
\ndisease and Alzheimer’s disease. Age-matched control subjects were all
\nparticipants in the Rush University Religious Order Study, a longitudinal
\nclinical–pathological study of ageing and Alzheimer’s disease,
\nwhich comprised older Catholic nuns, priests and brothers. Each participant
\nreceived a clinical evaluation that included an assessment for
\nmovement disorders. Details of the clinical evaluation were previously
\nreported (Chu et al., 2006). Subjects without psychiatric illnesses
\nduring life and neurological abnormalities at post-mortem were
\nincluded in the control group. The Human Investigation Committee
\nat Rush University Medical Centre approved this study. At autopsy,
\nthe brains were removed from the calvarium and processed as
\ndescribed previously (Chu et al., 2006). Briefly, each brain was cut
\ninto 1 cm coronal slabs using a Plexiglas brain slice apparatus and
\nthen hemisected. The slabs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
\n48 h at 4C. The left-side brain slabs were used for pathological diagnoses.
\nThe right-side brain slabs were cryoprotected in 0.1M PBS pH
\n7.4 containing 2% dimethyl sulphoxide, 10% glycerol for 48 h followed
\nby 2% dimethyl sulphoxide and 20% glycerol in PBS for at
\nleast 2 days before sectioning. The fixed slabs were cut into 18 adjacent
\nseries of 40 -mm-thick sections on a freezing sliding microtome.
\nAll sections were collected and stored in a cryoprotectant solution
\nbefore processing.
\n
\n## Injection of adeno-associated virus into rat brain.
\n
\nYoung adult Sprague–Dawley rats (both male and female; Charles
\nRiver Laboratories) were housed two to a cage with ad libitum
\naccess to food and water during a 12-h light/dark cycle; all animal
\nexperiments were approved by the Rush University Institutional Animal
\nCare and Use Committee. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)
\nserotype 6 vector encoding human mutant (A30P) -synuclein gene
\n(rAAV-h-A30P) and green fluorescent protein gene (rAAV-GFP) were
\nprepared and titred as described previously (Towne et al., 2008).
\nUnder xylazine/ketamine anaesthesia, 2 ml of the vector suspension
\nwas injected stereotaxically into the left nigral region (5.3mm posterior
\nand 2.3mm lateral to bregma; 7.7mm ventral to dura). The needle
\nwas kept in place for an additional 5 min before slowly
\nbeing withdrawn. At 6 weeks after injection, animals (rAAV-h-A30P,
\nn = 8; rAAV-GFP, n = 8) were perfused through the ascending aorta
\nwith physiological saline, followed by 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde.
\nThe brains were post-fixed in the same solution for
\n2 h, transferred to 10, 20 and 30% sucrose and sectioned on a freezing
\nmicrotome at 40 mm in the coronal plane. All sections were collected
\nand stored in order in a cryoprotectant solution before
\nprocessing.
\n
\n## Antibodies
\nSeveral antibodies that recognize axonal transport motor proteins,
\ntyrosine hydroxylase and -synuclein were used (Table 2). To control
\nfor antibody specificity, adsorption experiments were performed for
\nkinesin heavy chain (KHC) and kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) antibodies.
\nBriefly, these antibodies were combined with a 5-fold volume (by
\nweight) of blocking peptides (BP1575a for KHC, BP8637c for KLC1)
\nseparately in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4C. After
\ncentrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 20 min, adsorbed antibodies were
\nused in lieu of the primary antibody. Staining specificity was further
\nconfirmed by omitting the primary antibody (which controls for the
\nspecificity of the staining procedure) and replacement of the primary
\nantibody with an irrelevant IgG matched for protein concentration. All
\nthese control experiments resulted in a total absence of staining.
\nFluorescence intensity measurements
\nFluorescence intensity measurements were performed according to our
\npreviously published procedures (Chu et al., 2006, 2009; Kanaan
\net al., 2007). All immunofluorescence double-labelled images were
\nscanned with an Olympus Confocal Fluoroview microscope equipped
\nwith argon and krypton lasers. At low magnification (4), a virtual
\nslice was taken of each section and the substantia nigra pars compacta
\ndrawn. With a 20 magnification objective and a 488, 468, or
\n647nm excitation source, this system is specifically designed to acquire
\nimages at each sampling site in substantia nigra pars compacta. The
\nimages were saved to a file; the stage automatically moves to the next
\nsampling site to ensure a completely non-redundant evaluation. Once
\nall images were acquired, optical density measurements were performed
\non individual nigral neurons at the nuclear level. To maintain
\nconsistency of the scanned image for each slide, the laser intensity,
\nconfocal aperture, photomultiplier voltage, offset, electronic gain, scan
\nspeed, image size, filter and zoom were set for the background level
\nwhereby autofluorescence was not visible with a control section. These
\nsettings were maintained throughout the entire experiment (Chu
\net al., 2011). The intensity mapping sliders ranged from 0 to 4095;
\n0 represented a maximum black image and 4095 represented a maximum
\nbright image. The KHC-, KLC1- or DYNLT3-immunoreactive
\nperikarya co-labelled with tyrosine hydroxylase were identified and
\noutlined separately by an investigator blinded to the clinical and pathological
\ndata. Quantitative optical density of immunofluorescence
\nintensity was performed on individual KHC- and KLC1- or
\nDYNLT3-immunoreactive soma with tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabelling
\nin different channels. The same methods were used for quantitating
\noptical density of KLC1- or dynein-immunoreactive soma with
\nor without -synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions. For each marker,
\nfive equispaced sections across the entire length of the substantia
\nnigra were sampled and evaluated. The number of cells per case
\nwas analysed as follows: 4200 nigral cells in normal cases, 50–70
\nnigral cells per Parkinson’s disease case that contained inclusions and
\n4200 nigral cells per Parkinson’s disease case that did not contain
\ninclusions. To account for differences in background staining intensity,
\nfive background intensity measurements lacking immunofluorescent
\nprofiles were taken from each section. The mean of these five measurements
\nconstituted the background intensity that was then subtracted
\nfrom the measured immunofluorescence intensity of each
\nindividual neuron to provide a final immunofluorescence intensity
\nvalue. To confirm co-localization of the axonal transport marker and
\ntyrosine hydroxylase or -synuclein immunofluorescence, optical scanning
\nthrough the neuron’s z-axis was performed at 1-mm thickness
\nand neurons suspected of being double labelled were confirmed
\nwith confocal cross-section.
\n
\n## Data analyses
\nDemographic and clinical characteristics and optical density measurements
\nwere compared across groups with one-way ANOVA, Kruskal–
\nWallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons
\n(Prism 4, GraphPad Software, Inc.). Descriptive statistical level of significance
\nwas set at 0.05 (two-tailed).
\n
\n## Digital illustrations
\nConfocal images were exported from the Olympus laser scanning
\nmicroscope with Fluoview software and stored as .tif files.
\nConventional light microscopic images were acquired using a Nikon
\nMicrophoto-FXA microscope attached to a Nikon digital camera
\nDXM1200 and stored as .tif files. All figures were prepared using
\nPhotoshop 8.0 graphics software. Only minor adjustments of brightness
\nwere made.

\n# Results
\n## Characteristics of tyrosine hydroxylase labelling in different stages of sporadic Parkinson’s disease
\n
\nImmunohistochemistry revealed that the extent of tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive loss in the putamen was much
\ngreater than in the substantia nigra at early sporadic Parkinson’s
\ndisease stages (Supplementary Fig. 1E and G). Cases with Hoehn
\nand Yahr 1 Parkinson’s disease showed extensive and intense tyrosine
\nhydroxylase labelling in the substantia nigra, which was similar
\nto that seen in age-matched controls. A high density of
\ntyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive soma and an intricate local
\nplexus of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes were
\nobserved within the substantia nigra (Supplementary Fig. 1E and
\nF). In contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase labelling in putamen
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1G and H) was remarkably decreased in
\nearly stages of Parkinson’s disease compared with age-matched
\ncontrols (Supplementary Fig. 1C and D). In age-matched controls,
\ndense fine tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibres (50.25 mm) were distributed throughout the grey matter of putamen
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1C), consisting of a fine mesh of fibres
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1D). A small number of tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive thick fibres (40.5 mm) were also
\nobserved in the putamen. In early stage of Parkinson’s disease,
\nthe number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fine fibres
\nwas dramatically decreased throughout the putamen
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1G). Optical density measurements demonstrated
\na range of reductions between 31.64 and 60.79% within
\nputamen in the early stage of Parkinson’s disease, relative to
\nage-matched controls. The few remaining thick fibres displayed
\nan abnormal morphology characterized by swollen varicosities
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1H). In severe Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn
\nand Yahr: 3–5), there was a marked decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase
\nlabelling throughout the entire nigrostriatal system
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1I–P). Both tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive
\nnigral somas and dendrites in substantia nigra
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1J and N) were severely reduced compared
\nwith both cases with Hoehn and Yahr 1 Parkinson’s disease and
\nage-matched controls. In addition, many neuromelanin-laden
\nnigral neurons displayed no tyrosine hydroxylase labelling. Few
\nfine tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibres were observed
\nin the more ventromedial putamen near globus pallidus
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1K and O). Tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive
\nfine fibres were barely detected in the putamen,
\nand the few remaining thick fibres displayed swollen varicosities
\nand intervaricose segments (Supplementary Fig. 1L and P).
\nCollectively, these data indicated that loss of tyrosine hydroxylase
\nin target (putamen) of nigral neurons long precedes and exceeds
\nthat of nigral cell bodies (substantia nigra) early in sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease, suggesting that terminals are first impaired
\nduring dopaminergic neurodegeneration in sporadic Parkinson’s
\ndisease.
\n
\n## Reduced levels of conventional kinesin in nigral neurons affected in sporadic Parkinson’s disease
\nFindings of axonal transport alterations in familial Parkinson’s disease
\n(Chung et al., 2009; Scott et al., 2009) and toxin-based
\n(Morfini et al., 2007; Serulle et al, 2007) models led us to hypothesize
\nthat the early decline of tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive
\nterminals in nigrostriatal system observed in sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease (Supplementary Fig. 1) was associated
\nwith alterations in axonal transport motor proteins. Conventional
\nkinesin, a major microtubule-based motor protein responsible for
\nanterograde axonal transport is a heterotetramer composed of two
\nKHC and two KLC subunits. KHC-immunoreactive (Fig. 1A) and
\nKLC1-immunoreactive (Fig. 1E) neurons were widely distributed
\nthroughout the substantia nigra of age-matched control brains.
\nStrong KHC- and KLC1-immunoreactive profiles included both
\nperikarya and fibres in substantia nigra, and virtually all
\nneuromelanin-laden neurons were KHC- and KLC1 immunopositive.
\nIntense KHC- and KLC1 immunoreactivity were also observed
\nin scattered non-neuromelanin-laden small cells. In contrast,
\nimmunoreactivity for kinesin markers was markedly decreased in
\nall Parkinson’s disease brains. In the early stage of Parkinson’s
\ndisease (Hoehn and Yahr: 1–2), the immunoreactivity of KHC
\n(Fig. 1B) and KLC1 (Fig. 1F) was significantly lost in remaining
\nneuromelanin-laden neurons. Some neuromelanin-laden neurons
\ndisplayed KHC- and KLC-immunoreactive somas, but not processes,
\nwhereas staining others displayed none (Fig. 2B and F).
\nAt later Parkinson’s disease stages (Hoehn and Yahr: 3–5), the
\nmajority of remaining neuromelanin-laden neurons failed to display
\ndetectable KHC (Fig. 1C and D) and KLC1 (Fig. 1G and H),
\nwhereas a few neurons displayed a lightly stained soma. These
\nreductions in KHC and KLC1 were specific and not due to
\nParkinson’s disease-related degeneration of the actual neurite in
\nsubstantia nigra, as tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes
\nwere observed in remaining nigral neurons
\n(Supplementary Fig. 1). Non-neuromelanin-laden neurons in the
\nnigra, which are not dopaminergic, displayed KHC and KLC1
\nstaining in the both the soma and processes (Fig. 1C and D)
\ndemonstrating the specificity of this effect for dopaminergic
\nnigral neurons.
\nAnalysis of cytoplasmic dynein immunoreactivity in nigral neurons in Parkinson’s disease
\nWe next evaluated whether levels of the retrograde axonal transport
\nmotor protein cytoplasmic dynein were affected in dopaminergic
\nneurons of patients with sporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\nCytoplasmic dynein exists as a large, multisubunit protein complex
\nin vivo, formed by at least two heavy chains, two intermediate
\nchains, four light intermediate chains and several light chains
\n(Pfister et al., 1998). Among these, dynein light chain Tctex
\ntype 3 (DYNLT3) was chosen to be examined in sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease brains, as this subunit has been shown to contribute
\nto dynein cargo binding specificity (Lo et al., 2007).
\nDYNLT3 antibody labelled soma and processes of
\nneuromelanin-laden neurons in age-matched controls (Fig. 1I).
\nThe pattern of DYNLT3 immunostaining in Hoehn and Yahr 1
\nParkinson’s disease (Fig. 1I) was similar to age-matched controls,
\nas DYNLT3 was detected in almost all remaining
\nneuromelanin-laden neurons. In Hoehn and Yahr 3–5 cases with
\nParkinson’s disease, many neuromelanin-laden neurons failed to
\ndisplay detectable DYNLT3, whereas non-neuromelanin-laden
\ncells exhibited DYNLT3-labelling soma and processes (Fig. 1K
\nand L). Taken together, these data indicate that levels of
\nDYNLT3 are severely reduced in late stages of sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease, suggesting alterations in dynein functions in
\nParkinson’s disease.
\nCo-localization and quantitative analysis of axonal transport and
\ndopaminergic markers in nigral neurons in Parkinson’s disease
\nTo evaluate whether the decrease in axonal transport proteins
\ndocumented in sporadic Parkinson’s disease precedes those seen
\nfor dopamine markers, double immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase
\nand either conventional kinesin or cytoplasmic dynein markers
\nwas performed in nigral neurons of cases with sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease. Optical density measurements of these staining
\nprofiles were measured as described in the ‘Materials and
\nmethods’ section. In early Hoehn and Yahr 1 Parkinson’s disease
\ncases, co-localization analyses revealed that remaining
\nneuromelanin-laden neurons featuring intense tyrosine hydroxylase
\nimmunostaining [Fig. 2B(ii) and Supplementary Fig. 2B(2)]
\ndisplay light KHC-immunoreactive [Fig. 2B(i)] and KLC1-
\nimmunoreactive [Supplementary Fig. 2B(1)] staining, compared
\nwith age-matched controls [Fig. 2A(i) and Supplementary Fig.
\n2A(1)], with KHC- and KLC1-immunoreactive signals mainly detected
\nin perikarya and less extensively in processes, both of which
\nwere intensely labelled by tyrosine hydroxylase. In late cases with
\nParkinson’s disease (Hoehn and Yahr 4), minimal KHC [Fig. 2C(i)]
\nand KLC1 [Supplementary Fig. 2C(1)] staining was seen in neuronal
\ncell bodies. Significantly, non-dopaminergic neurons displayed
\nintense KHC-immunostained perikarya and processes [Fig. 2C(iii)]
\nsuggesting that alterations in conventional kinesin mainly affect
\nnigral dopaminergic neurons in sporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\nThe decline in intensity of DYNLT3 staining was observed in
\nlate sporadic Parkinson’s disease stages. In cases with early-stage
\nsporadic Parkinson’s disease, most of the remaining tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons exhibited intensive
\nDYNLT3-labelled soma and processes but a few of them appeared
\nlightly DYNLT3 labelled [Fig. 3B(i–iii)] compared with age-matched
\ncontrols [Fig. 3A(i–iii)]. In late sporadic Parkinson’s disease stages,
\nminimal DYNLT3 immunoreactivity was detected in tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive nigral neurons, whereas intensive
\nDYNLT3 staining was observed in non-tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive
\ncells [Fig. 3C(i–iii)]. Quantitative analyses of KHC-, KLC1- and DYNLT3-
\nimmunoreactivities were obtained for individual tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive cell bodies in early Parkinson’s disease
\n(Hoehn and Yahr 1–2), late Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn and
\nYahr 3–5) and age-matched control cases (Fig. 4). Kruskal–Wallis
\ntest revealed significant reductions in KHC levels across these experimental
\ngroups (Fig. 4A; P50.001). Post hoc analyses further
\nrevealed statistically significant decreases in optical densities of
\nKHC immunofluorescence signals in early Parkinson’s disease
\n(P50.05) and late Parkinson’s disease stages (P50.001), compared
\nwith age-matched controls. Similarly, significant differences
\nin optical density of KLC1 immunofluorescence signals were
\nobserved among the three groups analysed (Fig. 4B;
\nP50.0001). Post hoc analyses further revealed a significant decline
\nin the optical density of the KLC1 immunofluorescence signal
\nbetween early-stage Parkinson’s disease cases (P50.05) and
\nage-matched controls, between late Parkinson’s disease stages
\n(P50.001) and age-matched controls, and between early and
\nlate stages of Parkinson’s disease (P50.05). Kruskal–Wallis test
\ndemonstrated significant differences (P50.0001) in the optical
\ndensity of the DYNLT3 immunofluorescence signals across all experimental
\ngroups (Fig. 4C; P50.001). Post hoc analyses demonstrated
\na significant decrease in the optical density of the DYNLT3
\nimmunofluorescence signal only at late Parkinson’s disease stages
\n(P50.001; P50.05), compared with both age-matched control
\nand early Parkinson’s disease stages but not between early
\nParkinson’s disease stages and age-matched controls (P40.05).
\nThe optical density of the tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence
\nsignal was also measured in individual cells that were
\nKLC1 immunopositive from all Parkinson’s disease and
\nage-matched control cases (Fig. 4D; P50.001). Post hoc analyses
\nrevealed a significant decline in the optical density of tyrosine
\n
\nhydroxylase immunofluorescence signal in the late stage of
\nParkinson’s disease (P50.05; P50.001), relative to both early
\nParkinson’s disease stages and age-matched controls but not between
\nthe early stage of Parkinson’s disease and the age-matched
\ncontrol (P40.05).
\nTaken together, results from quantitative immunofluorescence
\nanalysis demonstrated significant reductions in conventional kinesin
\nlevels that precede tyrosine hydroxylase downregulation in remaining
\nnigral neurons of cases with sporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\nDownregulation of dynein DYNLT3 was observed in the late stage
\nof Parkinson’s disease but not in the early stage of Parkinson’s
\ndisease.
\n
\n## Co-localization and quantitative analysis of axonal transport markers and alpha-synuclein in the nigrostriatal system in Parkinson’s disease
\n
\nThe results above indicated that a marked reduction in levels of
\ncritical axonal transport proteins in tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunopositive
\nneurons in sporadic Parkinson’s disease, whereas
\nother neurons still displayed detectable-normal staining patterns.
\nOn the basis of results from our previous work (Chu et al., 2006,
\n2009), we hypothesized that the selective reductions in levels of
\naxonal transport motor subunits were related to -synuclein aggregation.
\nTo evaluate this possibility, we performed double labelling
\nwith anti--synuclein and either anti-KLC1 or anti-DYNLT3
\nantibodies and obtained the optical density measurements for
\nKLC1 and DYNLT3 for neurons with or without -synucleinimmunoreactive
\ninclusions in sporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\nCo-localization studies revealed that neurons both with or without
\n-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions had significantly lower
\ndensity of KLC1 immunoreactivity in Parkinson’s disease compared
\nwith age-matched controls (Fig. 5). Although cytoplasmic
\nnon-aggregated -synuclein (Fig. 5B) was present within most
\nnigral neurons in age-matched controls, levels of perikaryal
\nKLC1-immunoreactive were similar among -synuclein-positive
\nand -negative neurons (Fig. 5C). In contrast, a marked reduction
\nin levels of DYNLT3 immunoreactivity (Supplementary Fig. 3F)
\nwas only observed in Parkinson’s disease nigral neurons featuring
\n-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions. On the basis of these
\nfindings, we hypothesized that Lewy neurites may be associated
\nwith reduced levels of axonal transport motor proteins. To assess
\nthis possibility, an antibody detecting the aggregation prone,
\npS129--synuclein was used (Gorbatyuk et al., 2008).
\nDouble-immunolabelling studies revealed that phosphorylated
\n-synuclein was mainly detected in aberrant tyrosine hydroxylase-
\nimmunoreactive fibres displaying swollen varicosities but not
\nin morphologically normal tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive
\nfibres (Fig. 6A–F). Significantly, KHC1 immunoreactivity was
\nabsent in aberrant fibres displaying pS129--synuclein (Fig. 6G–I).
\nTo unequivocally determine whether decreases in levels of
\naxonal transport motors were associated -synuclein inclusions in
\nParkinson’s disease, we analysed the relative intensities of KLC1
\nand DYNLT3 in nigral neurons that did or did not contain
\n-synuclein-positive inclusions. Kruskal–Wallis test revealed a
\nstatistically significant difference in optical density of
\nKLC1-immunoreactive intensity across these groups (Fig. 7A;
\nP50.001). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant decrease of
\nKLC1-immunoreactive optical density in nigral neurons with
\n(P50.001) and without (P50.001) -synuclein-immunoreactive
\ninclusions compared with controls. Furthermore, nigral neurons
\nwith -synuclein inclusions in Parkinson’s disease displayed
\nhigher reductions in KLC1 immunoreactivity relative to
\nParkinson’s disease nigral neurons without -synuclein inclusions
\n(P50.05). Similarly, a significant difference in the optical density
\nof DYNLT3-immunoreactive intensity was revealed between the
\nthree groups (Fig. 7B; P50.001). Interestingly, post hoc analyses
\nrevealed that the optical density of DYNLT3-immunoreactive intensity
\nwas only significantly decreased in nigral neurons with
\n-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions (P50.001) but not in neurons
\nwithout -synuclein inclusions (P40.05) relative to
\nage-matched controls.
\nThese data indicate that in nigral neurons of cases with
\nsporadic Parkinson’s disease, the decrease in levels of conventional
\nkinesin subunits are independent of, but exacerbated
\nby, -synuclein inclusions, whereas reductions in DYNLT3
\nlevels are selectively associated with accumulated -synuclein
\ninclusions.
\n## Viral over-expression of alpha-synuclein in rat brain-induced alterations in tyrosine hydroxylase and axonal transport motor proteins
\nResults from immunohistochemical studies in sporadic Parkinson’s
\ndisease tissue led us to hypothesize that increased -synuclein
\nexpression results in reduced levels of critical axonal transport proteins.
\nTo evaluate this possibility, we analysed a well-studied rat
\nParkinson’s disease model based on viral (rAAV) over-expression
\nof mutant (A30P) -synuclein within the substantia nigra (Kirik
\net al., 2003; Chu et al., 2011). Control rats received intranigral
\ninjections of rAAV encoding GFP. In control rats, robust GFP expression
\nwas seen in the substantia nigra and striatum (data not
\nshown; Chu et al., 2011), but GFP expression did not affect tyrosine
\nhydroxylase levels in the nigrostriatal system (Supplementary
\nFig. 4). The LB509 antibody, which selectively recognizes human
\n-synuclein protein (Chu et al., 2011), was used to examine the
\nexpression of viral-encoded human -synuclein in rAAV-h-A30P injected rats. Intense LB509 immunoreactivity was observed in the
\nsubstantia nigra (Supplementary Fig. 4A and B) and striatum
\n(Supplementary Fig. 4G and H) of rats injected with
\nrAAV-h-A30P. As observed in cases with sporadic Parkinson’s disease,
\nloss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive terminals in striatum
\n(Supplementary Fig. 4I and J) and neurons in substantia
\nnigra (Supplementary Fig. 4C and D) was demonstrated in this
\nParkinson’s disease model (Chu et al., 2009, 2011; Ulusoy
\net al., 2010). Interestingly, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive
\nfine fibres were dramatically decreased (Supplementary Fig. 4I
\nand J) when -synuclein-immunoreactive fibres were radically
\nincreased (Supplementary Fig. 4G) in the majority of the striatum
\nof rAAV-h-A30P-injected rats. Some tyrosine hydroxylaseimmunoreactive
\nthick fibres still remained, but these displayed a
\ndistinct abnormal morphology characterized by swollen varicosities
\nand intervaricose segments (Supplementary Fig. 4J). Thus,
\npathological alterations in rats that received rAAV-h-A30P
\nmimicked the aberrant morphological features seen in cases with
\nsporadic Parkinson’s disease.
\nNext, we examined the levels of axonal transport proteins
\nin rAAV-h-A30P-injected rats. In substantia nigra of both uninjected
\nand AAV-GFP-injected rats, robust KHC (Fig. 8E and
\nSupplementary Fig. 5A) and DYNLT3 (Supplementary Figs. 5D
\nand 6E) immunoreactivities were documented. KHC and
\nDYNLT3 immunostaining profiles comprised both soma and
\nprocesses of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. Double
\nimmunostaining revealed that virtually all tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive nigral neurons were also KHC-
\n(Supplementary Fig. 5C) and DYNLT3 positive (Supplementary
\nFig. 5F).
\nIn the substantia nigra of AAV-h-A30P-injected rats, some neurons
\ndisplayed a marked loss of KHC (Fig. 8B) and DYNLT3 (Supplementary Fig. 6B) staining, whereas others retained an intense
\nimmunoreactive profile. Double labelling of KHC and
\nDYNLT3 with anti--synuclein antibody revealed two groups of
\nneurons in AAV6-h-A30P-injected substantia nigra. One group
\ndid not display -synuclein immunoreactivity, and these cells
\nshowed robust expression of both KHC and DYNLT3 markers.
\nThe second group expressed -synuclein and displayed a marked
\nreduction in KHC (Fig. 8C) and DYNLT3 (Supplementary Fig. 6C)
\nstaining levels. Aggregated pS129--synuclein was observed in
\nswollen tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibres (Fig. 9D–F)
\nin the striatum of rats that received AAV6-h-A30P. KHC levels
\nwere undetectable in fibres labelled with phosphorylated
\n-synuclein (Fig. 9G–I), similar to what was observed in
\nParkinson’s disease striatum (Fig. 6).
\nQualitative observations were confirmed by quantified fluorescence
\nintensity measurements for KHC and DYNLT3. The optical
\ndensity measurements of KHC and DYNLT3 were performed on

\n# Discussion
\nIn this study, we examined the expression of critical axonal transport
\nmotor proteins in remaining nigral dopaminergic neurons
\nthroughout different stages of sporadic Parkinson’s disease. The
\nmajor findings of this study are as follows: (i) conventional kinesin
\nlevels are significantly reduced in remaining nigral neurons in sporadic
\nParkinson’s disease. Significantly, this reduction occurs at very
\nearly Parkinson’s disease stages, suggesting that abnormalities in
\naxonal transport might represent a critical pathological change in
\nsporadic Parkinson’s disease. Interestingly, the reductions in conventional
\nkinesin levels precede the alterations in dopaminergic
\nphenotypic markers and the aberrant morphology of tyrosine
\nhydroxylase-immunoreactive fibres characteristic of early (stages
\n1–2) Parkinson’s disease; (ii) the reductions in conventional kinesin
\nlevels appear in the presence or absence of perikaryal -synuclein
\naggregations, the presence of -synuclein inclusions exhibit much
\nmore decline; (iii) unlike conventional kinesin, reductions in the
\nlevels of the DYNLT3 subunit of cytoplasmic dynein were only
\nobserved at late Parkinson’s disease stages; and (iv) reductions
\nin levels of conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein subunits
\nwere recapitulated in a rat model of familial Parkinson’s disease
\nbased on over-expression of human mutant -synuclein
\n(A30P).
\nWhat remains to be established is whether the alterations in
\naxonal transport result in the accumulation of -synuclein or
\nwhether the accumulation of -synuclein disturbs axonal transport.
\n-Synuclein normally functions as a synaptic protein (Iwai et al.,
\n1995). It is synthesized in nigral perikarya and transported to the
\nsynapse so quickly that it is undetectable in nigral cell bodies in
\nyoung non-human primates and young humans (Chu and
\nKordower, 2007). In aged monkeys and aged humans, -synuclein
\ncan be detected, and this is a time in these primates’ life where
\naxonal transport defects have been noted (Li et al., 2004; Cross
\net al., 2008). Supported by the present data, it is therefore tempting
\nto speculate that defects in axonal transport precede other
\nchanges leading to an accumulation of -synuclein within axon
\nand perikarya. So why is this accumulation of -synuclein not
\ncleared like other unwanted proteins? We have previously
\nshown that, in Parkinson’s disease, increases in -synuclein are
\nassociated with decreases in lysosomal and proteosomal proteins
\nthat normally clear excess -synuclein (Chu et al., 2009). These
\ndefects in autophagy-related proteins seen in Parkinson’s disease
\nand associated specifically with -synuclein accumulation can also
\nbe recapitulated with viral over-expression of -synuclein. Taken
\ntogether, these data support the conclusion that defects in axonal
\ntransport mechanisms are a primary event in nigral cell pathogenesis
\nleading to an abnormal accumulation in perikaryal -synuclein.
\nThis increase in -synuclein leads to a defective autophagic clearance
\nof this unwanted protein, starting a cycle of continually
\nincreasing -synuclein, which is now poorly transported to its
\nnormal synaptic location and poorly cleared by perikaryal proteins
\nsuch as LAMP1, the lysosomal protease cathepsin D and the 20S
\nproteasome (Chu et al., 2009). We believe that this continued
\naccumulation ultimately overwhelms these clearance mechanisms
\nresulting in the misfolding, fibrillization and aggregation of
\n-synuclein, a process that exacerbates synaptic loss, loss of dopaminergic
\nphenotype, striatal denervation and ultimately cell death.
\nThe fact that defects in kinesins can be seen in -synucleinpositive
\nand -negative nigral neurons supports this hypothesis.
\nHowever, one can still not rule out the possibility that -synuclein
\nis the primary culprit, and it is -synuclein that impairs axonal
\ntransport, setting this vicious cycle in motion. Indeed, this study
\ndemonstrates that viral over-expression of -synuclein alone reduces
\nthe expression of kinesins and dynein. This scenario deserves
\nfurther scrutiny as well.
\nPost-mortem studies must be interpreted with caution as factors
\nsuch as disease heterogeneity and post-mortem interval can influence
\nthe results. To support our findings, we injected rats with viral vectors inducing the over-expression of human -synuclein.
\nrAAV-h-A30P caused reductions in kinesin and dynein accompanied
\nby decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in
\nstriatum. Axons exhibit aberrant morphological profiles with
\naxonal swelling and enlarged intervaricose segments, both hallmarks
\nof axonal injury (Chung et al., 2009). The data from
\nAAV-h-A30P-injected animals exhibited reductions in kinesin and
\ndynein levels and abnormal axonal blockage were similar to those
\nobserved in early stage human Parkinson’s disease brains. These
\npre-clinical data support the accuracy of the human post-mortem
\nfindings.
\nA recent report indicated that viral over-expression of human
\nmutant (A53T) -synuclein results in a decrease in anterograde
\ntransport motor proteins in striatum but an increase in the substantia
\nnigra 8 weeks after the injection (Chung et al., 2009). Our
\nresults from 6 weeks following viral -synuclein over-expression
\ndiffer from Chung et al. (2009) in that we observed decreases in
\nboth the striatum and nigra. There are a number of explanations
\nfor these divergent results including those that may be related to
\nthe use of different mutant human -synuclein, different promoters
\nand different methods of protein evaluation (western
\nblots versus individual neuron evaluations taking into account
\nthe presence or absence of -synuclein). Our data from rat
\ngenetic Parkinson’s disease mode are similar to what we observed
\nin the Parkinson’s disease brain therefore supporting our preclinical
\ndata.
\nNatural -synuclein can be co-localized with axonal transport
\nproteins kinesin-1 and dynein and transported along axons
\n(Jensen et al., 1999; Utton et al., 2005). Over-expression of
\nhuman wild-type -synuclein enhances axonal degeneration after
\nperipheral nerve lesion in transgenic mice (Siebert et al., 2010).
\n-Synuclein accumulation was found at sites of axonal damage in
\nthe PNS (Moran et al., 2001; Siebert et al., 2010). These studies
\nsuggest that -synuclein accumulation is related to axonal
\ndamage. Our results further demonstrate that -synuclein accumulation
\nin axons is associated with a decline in kinesin along with
\ndecline of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity.
\nAlternatively, on encountering terminal damage, vesicles containing
\n-synuclein might undergo retrograde transport to the somatodendritic
\ncompartment, where aberrant -synuclein generation
\nand deposition could occur. Facial nerve axotomy results in higher
\namounts of immunopositive -synuclein in perikarya of neurons
\n(Moran et al., 2001), verifying the hypotheses that -synuclein
\nmight undergo retrograde transport to the somatodendritic compartments
\nafter axonal damage. This process could be enhanced
\nby the reduction of kinesin and the increase of dynein. Our results
\nrevealed that there was a severe decrease of kinesin but not
\ndynein in the early stage of Parkinson’s disease. If accumulation
\nof -synuclein occurs at sites of abnormal deposition of axonally
\ntransported cargos, reduced axonal transport may lead to local
\nstimulation of phosphorylated -synuclein processing and further
\ninhibition of axonal transport. This proposed sequence of events
\nwould generate an autocatalytic spiral, in which processes
\nleading to inhibition of axonal transport and phosphorylated
\n-synuclein production become mutually stimulatory, providing a
\nrational explanation for early striatal synaptic loss in Parkinson’s
\ndisease.
\nIn summary, the present data indicate that reductions in
\naxonal transport mechanisms are present during early stages in
\nnigrostriatal pathogenesis in Parkinson’s disease. Both anterograde
\nand retrograde motors are affected with anterograde motors
\n(kinesins) being defective first. These data were recapitulated in
\nrats with targeted viral over-expression of -synuclein. Taken together,
\nthese data suggest that therapies aimed at preventing or
\nrestoring defective axonal transport function should be
\ninvestigated.

\nSections through the mid-substantia nigra show immunoreactivity patterns of KHC (A–D),
\nKLC1 (E–H) and DYNLT3 (I–L) in age-matched controls (A, E and I), Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage 1 Parkinson’s disease (PD; B, F and J), Hoehn and Yahr stage 3
\nParkinson’s disease (C, G and K) and Hoehn and Yahr stage 5 Parkinson’s disease (D, H and L) cases. In age-matched controls, every neuromelanin-laden nigral neuron displayed intense KHC and KLC1 immunoreactivities in the soma and processes (A and E). In contrast, nigral neurons of Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 Parkinson’s disease cases display much lighter KHC- and KLC1-immunoreactive levels in neuronal somas, being hardly detected in some cells (arrows; B and F). KHC-labelling processes were severely reduced even when many neuromelanin-laden neurons remain present (B and F), compared with age-matched control (A and E). In Hoehn and Yahr stages 3 and 5 Parkinson’s disease cases, most of remaining neuromelanin-laden neurons showed no detectable KHC and KLC1 labelling (arrows; C, D, G and H). However, non-neuromelanin-laden cells exhibited strong KHC immunoreactivity in the soma and processes (arrowheads; C and
\nD). DYNLT3 immunoreactivity extent and intensity were not obviously decreased in Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 Parkinson’s disease (J) but severely declined in Hoehn and Yahr 3 (K) and Hoehn and Yahr 5 (L) compared with age-matched controls (I). Some remaining
\nneuromelanin-laden neurons exhibited no detectable DYNLT3 (arrows; K and L) but non-neuromelanin-laden neuron appeared DYNLT3-labelling soma and processes (arrowheads; K and L). Scale bar = 70 mm (applies to all).

\n### Abstract
\n
\nThe curry spice curcumin plays a protective role in mouse models of neurodegenerative dis- eases, and can also directly modulate aggregation of α-synuclein protein in vitro, yet no studies have described the interaction of curcumin and α-synuclein in genetic synucleinopa- thy mouse models. Here we examined the effect of chronic and acute curcumin treatment in the Syn-GFP mouse line, which overexpresses wild-type human α-synuclein protein. We discovered that curcumin diet intervention significantly improved gait impairments and re- sulted in an increase in phosphorylated forms of α-synuclein at cortical presynaptic termi- nals. Acute curcumin treatment also caused an increase in phosphorylated α-synuclein in terminals, but had no direct effect on α-synuclein aggregation, as measured by in vivo multi- photon imaging and Proteinase-K digestion. Using LC-MS/MS, we detected ~5 ng/mL and ~12 ng/mL free curcumin in the plasma of chronic or acutely treated mice, with a glucuroni- dation rate of 94% and 97%, respectively. Despite the low plasma levels and extensive me- tabolism of curcumin, these results show that dietary curcumin intervention correlates with significant behavioral and molecular changes in a genetic synucleinopathy mouse model that mimics human disease.
\n
\n### Introduction
\n
\nCurcumin, the main component of turmeric spice, is a natural compound found in the root of the Curcuma longa plant. Of the three main curcuminoids found in the turmeric root, curcu- min is the most abundant and the most biologically active. Much research has demonstrated that this polyphenolic compound has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloidogenic properties. These properties are particularly relevant for treatment of neurodegenerative dis- eases, and curcumin has been shown to alleviate cell death and neuronal loss in cellular and an- imal models of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s Disease, and stroke [1,2]. Curcumin has been extensively studied in mouse models of AD, where it has been shown to reduce A-beta plaque size, reduce soluble A-beta, suppress soluble tau dimers, and lower oxidative stress [3–6]. While studies in mouse models of PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) are more limited, experiments from a toxin-induced mouse model of PD show that curcumin reverses neurodegeneration by blocking mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [7].
\n
\nIn addition to promoting mitochondrial health and reducing oxidative stress, curcumin may be beneficial in PD and DLB by directly modulating aggregation of α-synuclein protein. α-synuclein is the most abundant protein found in Lewy Bodies (LBs), the pathological hall- mark of PD and DLB, and is genetically and molecularly linked to neurodegeneration in both human patients and mouse models of disease [8,9]. Curcumin protects against α-synuclein-in- duced cell death in tissue culture cells by inhibiting mitochondrial toxicity and formation of re- active oxygen species [10,11]. Furthermore, curcumin directly binds to α-synuclein in vitro, and can both inhibit and reverse the formation of toxic α-synuclein aggregate species [12]. Mo- lecular interaction studies reveal that curcumin binds to the non-amyloid-beta component (NAC) domain of α-synuclein to shield hydrophobic residues that drive self-aggregation, thus promoting and stabilizing non-aggregate forms of the protein in vitro [13]. Ahmad and col- leagues also found that curcumin could dis-aggregate higher-order oligomeric and fibrillar forms of the protein, which are thought to be the toxic species. Because curcumin can dis-ag- gregate pre-formed α-synuclein aggregates, this suggests curcumin could potentially be used therapeutically, not just preventatively, to halt or reverse the disease process after it has already caused clinical symptoms.
\nTo date, the effect of curcumin in genetic mouse models of PD, DLB, and related synuclei- nopathies that closely mimic human disease, has not been examined. We use transgenic mice with 2-3-fold over-expression of human GFP-tagged wild-type α-synuclein (Syn-GFP), which mimics duplication and triplication mutations found in some human patients [14,15]. Using a combination of in vivo multi-photon imaging through a cranial window and biochemical anal- ysis of fresh and fixed brain tissue, we have previously characterized a pool of phosphorylated Syn-GFP microaggregates in cortical presynaptic terminals from these mice [15]. In this study, we examined the effect of both chronic and acute curcumin treatment on motor behavior, α- synuclein phosphorylation, and aggregation in these mice. We found that a moderate dose of dietary curcumin significantly improved the motor phenotype of Syn-GFP mice, and that this correlated with an increase in phosphorylated α-synuclein protein at cortical presynaptic ter- minals. We further found that acute treatment of curcumin for 2 weeks via i.p. injection did not significantly affect Syn-GFP aggregates in vivo or in fixed and fresh brain tissue, but did have the same effect of increasing phosphorylated α-synuclein. Combined these results indicate that curcumin intervention promotes phosphorylation of α-synuclein, which may contribute to improved motor behavior over time.
\n
\n## Experimental Procedures
\n### Mice
\nMice were housed by Oregon Health and Science University’s Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM) or the Veterans Affairs Medical Center’s Veterinary Medical Unit, held in a light-dark cycle, temperature- and humidity-controlled animal vivarium, and maintained under ad libitum food and water diet supplied by the DCM. Syn-GFP (PDNG78 line; [14]) het- erozygous male mice were mated to BDF1 females from Charles River Laboratories. Male and female mice between 3 and 10 months old were used for experiments. All experiments were ap- proved by the OHSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number: IS01185) and every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
\nChronic and acute curcumin treatments. Mouse diet containing 500 ppm dietary supple- ment grade curcumin (Chromadex, Irvine, CA), premixed in soybean oil prior to incorporation into the diet, or control diet containing an equal amount of oil without curcumin, was made by Harlan Teklad. For chronic treatment, age matched male and female mice (n = 2 per sex per treatment group) were placed on the modified diet at 3 months of age, and were maintained on the diet for 6 months until the time of sacrifice. Mice were single housed, and animals and diet were weighed every day for 5 days at the start of the diet intervention, then weekly thereafter to measure weight gain and consumption. For acute curcumin treatment, mice with previously installed cranial windows were treated with 15 mg/kg/day dietary supplement grade curcumin or 50% DMSO/D-PBS vehicle control i.p. daily for 15 days. Mice were given soft food and daily i.p. injections of D-PBS to maintain hydration for the duration of the treatment. Imaging ex- periments were performed one day prior to the start of treatment, and at 7 and 14 days of treat- ment. On day 15 of treatment, mice were sacrificed 5 hours after the last curcumin or DMSO injection.
\n
\n## Behavioral Analysis
\n
\n1 day prior to behavioral testing, mice were acclimated to the testing room for 30 minutes. Gait analysis was performed on a DigiGait treadmill (Mouse Specifics, Quincy, MA), with a speed of 24 cm/sec, with 2–4 seconds of video analyzed for each mouse. In between animals, the treadmill was wiped down with Nolvasan and 70% ethanol. Mice were run on a declined plat- form (achieved by elevating the back end of the treadmill 8 inches off the ground) on day 1 of testing, rested for 4 days, then run on a flat platform. Muscle strength was tested using a Grip Strength Meter (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH); all limbs, then forelimbs only were tested.
\n
\nTissue Collection. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100mg/kg/10mg/kg), and blood was collected from the heart into heparinized tubes using the cardiac puncture tech- nique. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes, and plasma samples were immediately snap frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Following blood removal, animals were sacrificed via cervical dislocation, and the brain was dissected out of the skull, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs were removed, and the remaining tissue was bisected along the midline. Half the brain was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in a circulating water bath for 1 h, 150 W, at 30°C using a BioWave (Pelco, Ted Pella, Inc, Redding, CA) microwave fixation system, then postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C. The other half of the brain was homoge- nized in Syn-PER Synaptic Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher), and synaptosome and cytosolic components were isolated according to the manufacturers protocol. Fixed brain tissue was mounted on a Leica VT1000 S Vibratome and sagittally sectioned into 50 μm slices, which were then stored in PBS/0.05% sodium azide at 4°C.
\n
\n## LC-MS/MS Analysis
\n
\nLC-MS/MS analysis was based on a previously validated method for quantitation of curcumin in plasma [16]. Experimental plasma samples and blank mouse plasma spiked with known amounts of curcumin were treated as follows, in triplicate. Frozen samples were thawed on ice, and 50 μL of sample was mixed with 150 μL acetonitrile containing 0.15 ng/μL honokiol inter- nal standard (Sigma). For enzyme treatment, curcumin spiked plasma standards and experi- mental plasma samples (50 μL) were incubated with 5 μL B-glucuronidase (20 units, Type H-2, Sigma G0876) at 37°C for 1 hour. Precipitated protein was separated by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 5 minutes. The remaining supernatant was filtered through 0.22 μ Millipore Dura- por PVDF spin filter, and 10 μL was injected onto a Zorbax Extend-C18 column (4.6x150mm, 5 μm, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The mobile phase was a mixture of (A) water and (B) acetoni- trile, both containing 0.02% formic acid. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min, and the following gra- dient was applied: 50–95% B over 0–5 min, 95% B for 3 min, followed by a return to 50% B and equilibration. For MS/MS analysis the Shimadzu Prominence HPLC was interfaced to an Ap- plied BioSystems 4000 Q-TRAP hybrid triple-quadrupole, linear ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray interface (ESI) used in negative ion mode, with the following source parame- ters: source voltage, -4.5 kV; source temperature, 500°C; Ion source gas 1, 20; ion source gas 2, 50l/h; curtain gas, 15; interface heater, on. Curcumin and honokiol were measured using multi- ple reaction monitoring (MRM) and optimal parameters were determined by direct infusion of each compound (Table 1). The collision gas was set to medium.
\n
\n## Immunohistochemistry
\n
\nHuman frontal cortex from a patient with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and a normal healthy control were obtained from the OHSU Brain Bank, and 50 μm sections were cut on a Leica VT1000 S Vibratome. To detect phosphorylated α-synuclein in both human and mouse tissue, brain sections were blocked in 0.1% Triton-X, 10% goat serum for 1–2 hours, then stained with rabbit monoclonal S129-P-α-synuclein antibody (Abcam, catalogue number ab51253, 1:1000 for mouse tissue, 1:500 for human tissue) overnight at 4°C, washed extensive- ly, then stained with goat anti-rabbit Alexa-647 (Invitrogen) at 1:2000 overnight at 4°C. Mouse brain tissue was mounted in CFMR2 (Citifluor, London, UK), which partially cleared the tissue to allow for deeper imaging depths, and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. IMARIS software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to quantify GFP and S129-P fluo- rescence at individual synapses, and the CoLoc function was used to analyze S129-P/GFP colo- calization. For curcumin or Thioflavin-S (ThS) co-staining in human brain tissue, sections were first stained with antibodies, then washed in 70% ethanol, incubated with 10 μM curcu- min or 0.05% ThS in 50% ethanol for 10–15 minutes, washed again in 70% ethanol, and rehy- drated in water. Tissue was mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with the spectral imaging with line- ar unmixing module. Spectral imaging was performed in lambda mode using a 9.7nm gradient width and 34 PMT detectors for a 419–691 nm wavelength range.
\n
\n## Proteinase-K and Western Blot analysis
\n
\nProteinase-K-resistant aggregates were analyzed by incubating synaptosome and cytosolic brain fractions with 10 μg/mL Proteinase-K (Thermo Scientific) for 30 minutes at 37°C, fol- lowed by SDS-PAGE western blot using the Li-cor Odyssey CLx quantitative western blot im- aging system. Syn-GFP blot signal was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFP (Abcam, 1:2000), and data was quantified using LiCor Image Studio software.
\n
\n## Cranial window surgery and in vivo imaging
\n
\nCranial window surgery, in vivo imaging and photobleaching experiments were performed as previously described [15]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2%) and a cranial window was surgically installed on the skull. Following surgery, animals were monitored for pain and given daily i.p. injections of buprenorphine for 1–3 days, as needed. Imaging experi- ments were begun at least 3 weeks following placement of the cranial window. For multiphoton imaging, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, mounted to a custom stereotaxic frame, and imaged using a 20x/1.0NA water immersion objection and a Zeiss LSM 7MP multiphoton microscope, outfitted with dual channel BiG (binary GaAsP) detectors and the Coherent Cha- meleon titanium-sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser source, tuned to 860 nm. Baseline images of Syn-GFP-labeled cell bodies and presynaptic terminals in cortical layers 2/3 were obtained using 1–3 mW power (measured at objective exit). Large square regions of interest (ROI, 53x53 μm2) encompassing 50–100 terminals were bleached with ~100–150 mW power over <10 ms, and recovery images were acquired at 1–5 minute intervals, for 15 minutes. Zeiss Zen 2011 image acquisition software was used for image acquisition, and data was analyzed using Fiji image analysis software (http://fiji.sc/). The background-subtracted fluorescence intensity of the ROI was calculated for each time point and graphed as normalized fluorescence intensity vs. time using Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The data was fit as a one-phase associ- ation to calculate the tau recovery rate and the immobile fraction.
\n
\n## Statistics
\n
\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using Prism software (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA), and all data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. For behavioral analysis, right and left paw data was averaged for the fore paws or hind paws for each animal, then data for each animal in a group were averaged, to yield an n = 4 animals per group. Unless otherwise noted, unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were used to determine significance between groups. Since no significant dif- ferences were detected between male and female mice, results from both sexes were combined.
\n
\n## Results
\n
\nCurcumin binds to Lewy Bodies in diseased human brain tissue
\nTo eliminate confounding effects due to variations in purification methods or the presence of other curcuminoids, we used synthetic curcumin, as opposed to turmeric root or extracted cur- cumin. We found that curcumin from Chromadex was >99% pure by HPLC, stable in 100% DMSO solution over 1 week, and stable as a powder for over 1 year.
\n
\nWe next characterized the ability of curcumin to bind to LBs in diseased human brain tissue. Previous data has shown that curcumin labels human A-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tan- gles, suggesting a specific preference for proteins in a beta-sheet rich amyloid confirmation, similar to dyes such as Thioflavin-S/T and Congo Red [5,17,18]. Because human brain tissue contains significant amounts of lipofuscin autofluorescence, which overlaps with the broad curcumin emission spectrum, we found that spectral imaging combined with linear unmixing was useful to accurately detect curcumin staining above the autofluorescent background in the tissue. Using a Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope with spectral unmixing capabili- ties, we were able to isolate two autofluorescent spectra, as well as separate spectra for curcu- min and Alexa-647 secondary antibodies, with minimal unassigned residual light (Fig 1A). This technique resulted in clear separation of each fluorescent component, particularly the autofluorescence-2 channel and curcumin, which have closely overlapping spectra that are dif- ficult to tease apart using regularly available emission filters [5]. Using this technique, we found that curcumin binds to Serine-129-phosphorylated (S129-P)-α-synuclein-positive corti- cal LBs in human brain tissue from patients with DLB (Fig 1B–1G). While it appeared as though the LBs may contain a smaller central core of S129-P-α-synuclein, with a larger region of curcumin staining outside this core, we believe that this is likely a result of the software at- tempting to clearly assign only one spectral component to the LB core. In normal control brain tissue, no staining for S129-P-α-synuclein was seen (S1 Fig). To our knowledge, this is the first report of curcumin binding to LBs in human brain tissue.
\n
\n## Free and glucuronidated curcumin are present in plasma from mice on a curcumin diet
\n
\nGiven this data that curcumin can bind to, and therefore potentially modulate, aggregated α- synuclein in human tissue, we next set out to test its effects in synucleinopathy mouse models. To examine the long-term effects of curcumin, we treated Syn-GFP mice with 500 ppm curcu- min diet or control diet for 6 months. Food consumption and body weight were monitored weekly; no significant differences between curcumin and control diet mice were found at any time point (Fig 2A and 2B). Motor behavior was assessed at 23 weeks, and brain tissue and plasma was harvested at 24 weeks.
\n
\nWe used a previously validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC– MS/MS) method to measure curcumin levels in plasma samples after dietary treatment [16]. In both spiked control plasma matrix and experimental samples, we detected a single peak corre- sponding to curcumin (molecular weight 368) by following the 367/133 and 367/217 MRM transitions (Fig 2C). The 367/133 transition values were used for quantification of curcumin. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was calculated as 5 ng/mL due to this being the lowest value on the standard curve, although curcumin peaks were clearly detectable with signal to noise ratios greater than 10:1 at lower concentrations, and the lower limit of detection (LLOD) was 0.033 ng/mL. Standard curves were linear in the range of 0–500 ng/mL curcumin
\n(r = 0.998±0.002). We found an average plasma curcumin concentration of < 5 ng/mL (4.40± 5.72 ng/mL) in 3 out of 4 mice on a curcumin diet (Table 2). One sample did not contain de- tectable curcumin, likely because of rapid metabolism of free curcumin (see below) and a de- layed period of time between the last food consumption time point (at the end of the dark cycle in the early morning) and sacrifice (early afternoon). We did not detect curcumin in plasma from control diet mice.
\n
\nCurcumin is rapidly metabolized in vivo through two pathways—reduction of the com- pound to dihydrocurcumin, tetrahydro-curcumin, and hexahydrocurcumin, and addition of a sugar group to yield curcumin-glucuronide versions of the parent compound and each of the three metabolites. Previous research has shown that up to 99% of curcumin is rapidly glucuro- nidated in vivo [19]. To examine the levels of curcumin-glucuronide in mice on a curcumin diet, we treated plasma samples with B-glucuronidase prior to LC-MS/MS, to remove the sugar and reduce the compound back to free curcumin. After enzyme treatment, we found an average curcumin concentration of 12.52±10.68 ng/mL, indicating that 94.1±7.3% of curcumin was glucuronidated in plasma from curcumin diet mice (Table 2). Enzyme treatment did allow us to detect curcumin in the mouse sample that had no free curcumin (mouse #183), indicating that 100% of the curcumin in this mouse was glucuronidated. Surprisingly, mouse #164 had a lower concentration of curcumin in plasma after enzyme treatment, perhaps indicating that the curcumin in this sample had degraded during freeze/thaw cycles between the initial mass spec run and the enzyme treatment experiment.

\n## Curcumin diet intervention improves motor behavior
\n
\nAutomated gait analysis is a highly sensitive tool for measuring changes in multiple gait param- eters in mouse models of PD, Huntington’s Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [20]. To examine the effects of curcumin intervention on motor behavior, we tested curcumin and control diet mice using automated gait analysis on the DigiGait machine, and measured changes in several parameters. On a declined platform, there was a significant increase in hind paw angle in curcumin diet mice (5.0±2.5 degrees for control diet, 14.1±5.6 degrees for curcu- min diet, p<0.05). On a flat platform, mice on a curcumin diet showed a significant increase in fore paw swing duration (87.7±0.3 ms for control diet, 101.3±5.1 ms for curcumin diet, p<0.01; Fig 3A) and a non-significant trend towards a decrease in hind paw stride frequency (3.9±0.1 steps/sec for control diet, 3.6±0.2 steps/sec for curcumin diet, p = 0.0671), compared to control diet mice. Combined, these two parameters indicate that control diet mice took a greater number of shorter steps in a given time period, which is consistent with gait changes re- ported in a toxin-induced mouse model of PD [21]. These altered gait dynamics in our mouse model are due to expression of the Syn-GFP transgene, and curcumin diet intervention was able to partially normalize this deficit.
\nStrikingly, the ataxia coefficient, an index of step-to-step variability that is increased in human PD patients, was significantly decreased in the fore paws for curcumin diet mice com- pared to control (0.55±0.10 for control diet, 0.32±0.05 for curcumin diet, p<0.01; Fig 3B). Two other PD-associated parameters, the variability in stride length and stance width in the fore paws, were also decreased in curcumin diet mice (stride length variability = 15.76±2.72% for control diet, 10.18±1.74% for curcumin diet, p<0.05; stance width variability = 27.55±3.85% for control diet, 12.95±5.05% for curcumin diet, p<0.01; Fig 3C and 3D). Stride length variabil- ity is higher in patients with PD [22,23]. In mice, the normal range is 10–12% and is increased in a toxin-induced mouse model of PD [21]. Increased stance width variability is associated with PD in human patients, and is normally in the range of 10–15% in mice [21,24]. While control diet mice fall outside of the normal range for both of these parameters, curcumin diet intervention normalized the effect of over-expressing the Syn-GFP transgene to return these mice to the normal range.
\n
\nWe also tested muscle strength in curcumin and control diet mice, using a Grip Strength Meter, and found no significant difference between groups (control diet = 2.65±0.31 Newtons, curcumin diet = 2.62±0.29 Newtons; p = 0.8723). This result is consistent with a separate study that showed no change in grip strength in a Pink1 genetic model of PD [25]. This supports the idea that the motor phenotype we detect is similar to PD-like phenotypes, and is not a result of changes in muscle strength.
\n
\nCurcumin diet intervention results in an increase in phosphorylated α- synuclein
\nWe next examined molecular changes in α-synuclein as a result of curcumin diet intervention, using immunohistochemical and biochemical assays on fixed and fresh brain tissue. We previ- ously found that presynaptic Syn-GFP terminal microaggregates contain S129-P forms of α- synuclein, and are resistant to digestion by Proteinase-K [15]. Here we find that staining for S129-P-α-synuclein was increased in presynaptic terminals in mice that were on a curcumin diet (Fig 4A and 4B). We found that there was no change in GFP fluorescence in presynaptic termi- nals, but there was an increase in the number, area, volume, and fluorescence of presynaptic S129-P puncta (control diet GFP fluorescence = 5373±1039 AU, curcumin diet GFP fluores- cence = 5171±955 AU, p = 0.3767; control diet S129-P fluorescence = 13641±1006 AU, curcumin diet S129-P fluorescence = 15170±1471 AU, p<0.0001; control diet S129-P number = 454±186, curcumin diet S129-P number = 604±146; p<0.0005; control diet S129-P area = 0.9±0.1 μm2, curcumin diet S129-P area = 1.1±0.1 μm2, p<0.0001; control diet S129-P volume = 0.052± 0.009 μm3, curcumin diet S129-P volume = 0.066±0.011 μm3, p<0.0001; Fig 4C). When we looked exclusively at Syn-GFP-positive terminals, we also detected a significant increase in S129-P levels, as measured by analyzing the amount of colocalization between S129-P and Syn- GFP (control diet Pearson’s coefficient = 0.16±0.06, curcumin diet Pearson’s coefficient = 0.23± 0.5, p<0.01, Fig 4D and 4E). Combined, these IHC findings indicate that chronic exposure to curcumin results in a global increase in α-synuclein phosphorylation state, at both synapses that contain endogenous mouse α-synuclein and synapses that over-express the human Syn-GFP protein. We also found a strong correlation between plasma levels of curcumin and S129-P fluo- rescence intensity, in individual mice (Fig 4F).
\nTo biochemically examine aggregates, we isolated synaptosome and cytosolic proteins from whole brain extracts of mice that were on a curcumin or control diet. Our previous work dem- onstrated that Syn-GFP mice contain a single species of Syn-GFP, identified by molecular weight under denaturing SDS-PAGE western blot conditions, and do not contain multiple SDS-resistant aggregate species of different molecular weights [15]. We further found that ~35% of Syn-GFP in synaptosomes is resistant to digestion by Proteinase-K, compared to ~2% of cytosolic Syn-GFP [15]. In curcumin diet mice, we did not detect any significant changes in the Syn-GFP Proteinase-K-resistant fraction in synaptosomes or cytosolic compartments, indi- cating that chronic curcumin treatment has no effect on Proteinase-K-resistant aggregates in these mice (control diet synaptosome fraction = 0.30±0.14, curcumin diet synaptosomes frac- tion = 0.40±0.09, p = 0.2654; control diet cytosolic fraction = 0.03±0.02, curcumin diet cytosol- ic fraction = 0.03±0.03, p = 0.9762; Fig 5).
\n
\n## Acute curcumin treatment modulates phosphorylation of α-synuclein, but has no effect on in vivo aggregation
\n
\nTo look more directly at the effect of curcumin on terminal microaggregates in vivo, we adopted an acute curcumin treatment paradigm that we could apply to Syn-GFP mice that had surgically-installed cranial windows over the cortex. We have shown previously that Syn-GFP terminal microaggregates have slower recovery kinetics and a significant immobile fraction in Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, compared to soluble Syn- GFP in the cell body [15]. We treated mice with 15 mg/kg/day curcumin or DMSO vehicle con- trol i.p. for 15 days, and examined FRAP kinetics at pre-injection, 7 day, and 14 day time points. We found no significant change in the immobile fraction (IF) or the tau recovery rate due to curcumin treatment (pretreatment DMSO IF = 0.52±0.11, 1 week DMSO IF = 0.53± 0.10, 2 week DMSO IF = 0.48±0.11, pretreatment curcumin IF = 0.49±0.15, 1 week curcumin IF = 0.48±0.14, 2 week curcumin IF = 0.36±0.16; pretreatment DMSO tau = 3.00±1.66 ms, 1 week DMSO tau = 3.66±2.17 ms, 2 week DMSO tau = 3.90±2.38 ms, pretreatment curcumin tau = 2.83±1.16 ms, 1 week curcumin tau = 2.58±0.96 ms, 2 week curcumin tau = 2.56±5.68 ms; Fig 6). A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there no effect of time or treat- ment, and no interaction effect (interaction p = 0.6927, time p = 0.1846, treatment p = 0.1471), although there was a trend towards a decrease in the immobile fraction over time in some cur- cumin regions analyzed.
\n
\nIn agreement with the in vivo FRAP data, we also found no significant change in the Pro- teinase-K-resistant fraction in fresh brain tissue from acutely-treated mice (S2 Fig). Similar to chronic curcumin treatment, we detected an increase in S129-P-α-synuclein in cortical synapses in acutely-treated curcumin mice, compared to DMSO treated controls (DMSO GFP fluorescence = 7659±2327 AU, curcumin GFP fluorescence = 8185±1483 AU, p = 0.4065; DMSO S129-P fluorescence = 12419±690 AU, curcumin S129-P fluorescence = 14931±3302 AU, p<0.001; DMSO S129-P number = 447±143, curcumin S129-P number = 523±238; p = 0.2023; DMSO S129-P area = 0.9±0.1 μm2, curcumin S129-P area = 1.1±0.2 μm2, p<0.01; DMSO S129-P volume = 0.050±0.013 μm3, curcumin S129-P volume = 0.066±0.025 μm3, p<0.05; Fig 7A–7C). However, when we looked specifically at Syn-GFP-positive synapses, we detected a significant decrease in S129-P levels after 2 weeks of curcumin treatment, as indicated by a smaller Pearson’s colocalization coefficient between GFP and S129-P (DMSO Pearson’s coefficient = 0.19±0.07, curcumin Pearson’s coefficient = 0.11±0.05, p<0.001; Fig 7D and 7E).
\n
\nFinally, we detected an average of 11.55±2.51 ng/mL free curcumin in plasma from 15-day curcumin treated mice, which were sacrificed 5 hours after the last curcumin treatment
\n(Table 2). Following B-glucuronidase treatment of plasma, we detected an average of 372.89± 104.24 ng/mL curcumin, indicating that 96.6±1.5% of curcumin in the blood is glucuronidated 5 hours after i.p. injection (Table 2). Unlike chronic curcumin treatment, there was no correla- tion between plasma levels of curcumin and S129-P fluorescence intensity, in individual mice that received acute curcumin treatment (Fig 7F).
\n
\n## Discussion
\n
\nWe have found that transgenic α-synuclein mice show improvements in gait after chronic treatment with a moderate dose of dietary curcumin. For a 500 ppm curcumin diet, daily con- sumption rates of ~ 4 g of food would result in 2 mg of curcumin consumed per day over a 6 month period. Despite well-established problems of low bioavailability [16,26], many of curcu- min’s cellular mechanisms of action occur in the nM to μM range. Indeed, 0.1–1.0 μM concen- trations of curcumin can protect against α-synuclein-induced cell death in tissue culture cells, and curcumin was shown to disaggregate α-synuclein aggregates in vitro at concentrations of 0.5–5.0 μM [10,12]. Here we extend these in vitro findings to show, for the first time in a genet- ic synucleinopathy mouse model, that a moderate dose of dietary curcumin is sufficient to im- prove motor phenotype.
\n
\nUsing LC-MS/MS, we measured mean values of ~4.5 ng/mL free curcumin (range 0–11 ng/mL) and ~12.5 ng/mL total curcumin (range 2–27 ng/mL; free and glucuronidated) in plas- ma from curcumin diet mice. However, these values are probably lower than peak plasma levels actually attained. Plasma was collected in the early afternoon, leaving at least 6 hours between the end of the dark cycle and thus, likely the last significant food consumption time point. Be- cause the half-life of oral curcumin in mouse plasma is 3.5 hours [19], it is likely that curcumin plasma levels significantly declined due to the lag in collection time. The lag between the last feeding and collection may also contribute to some of the variability between samples. A previ- ous group reported 35 ng/mL curcumin in plasma from mice on a 500 ppm diet for 4 months [3], but these authors did not report timing of the plasma collection relative to the dark cycle or last feeding time point. With acute curcumin dosing, we detected mean values of ~12 ng/mL free curcumin (range 9–13 ng/mL) and ~373 ng/mL total curcumin (range 273–481 ng/mL; free and glucuronidated) in plasma from mice that were treated with 15 mg/kg/day (450 μg) i.p. curcumin for 15 days, and sacrificed 5 hours after the last curcumin treatment. This is also lower than previous reports, which found 127 ng/mL curcumin in plasma 4 hours after 140 μg was injected i.p. into an AD mouse model [3]. These differences could be due to variable me- tabolism in the different mouse strains used.
\n
\nIn this study, in order to measure curcumin’s molecular effects on α-synuclein, half of each mouse brain was fixed for IHC and the other half processed for synaptosome isolation and sub- sequent biochemistry; therefore, there was insufficient tissue to attempt to measure brain curcumin levels by LC-MS/MS. Curcumin does cross the blood-brain barrier [3,19], and Begum et al. found 0.47 μg/g (1.28 μM) and 0.74 μg/g (2.01 μM) in mouse brain tissue follow- ing chronic dietary and i.p. delivery methods, respectively. These authors showed that with 4 months of chronic dosing with a curcumin diet identical to ours (500 ppm curcumin diet), cur- cumin was highly enriched in mouse brain tissue, with a brain-to-plasma ratio of 13.4 [3]. With acute dosing, using an i.p. dose of curcumin that is half of the dosage used in our study, they found a brain-to-plasma ratio of 5.85, 4 hours after treatment [3]. These results highlight that curcumin, a lipophilic compound, is more stable in brain than in plasma, and can reach concentrations that are within the range of what has been shown to affect α-synuclein cellular function in vitro (see above). Interestingly, we found a strong positive correlation between in- creased levels of S129-P at individual cortical terminals and plasma levels of curcumin, in indi- vidual mice that were on a curcumin diet (Fig 4). This underscores the accumulation and stability of curcumin in lipid-rich brain tissue, particularly with chronic treatment, and lends further support to the brain-specific effects of dietary curcumin in our system. Because curcu- min is intrinsically auto-fluorescent, we also attempted to directly measure global curcumin fluorescence or curcumin localization to individual presynaptic terminals using in vivo cranial window imaging, but did not detect any significant changes in fluorescence at either 1–3 hours or 7–14 days after acute curcumin treatment.
\nThe Syn-GFP mouse mimics human duplication and triplication mutations to model cellu- lar changes that occur due to 2-3-fold over-expression of α-synuclein. The presence of α-synu- clein microaggregates in presynaptic terminals, but not cell bodies, makes this mouse an excellent in vivo model of early cellular aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which occurs in many diseases including PD, DLB, and related synucleinopathies [15]. Syn-GFP mice do not show extensive neurodegeneration, severe motor decline, or early mortality rates, compared to more severe mouse models which more strongly overexpress α-synuclein bearing point mutations [14]. Despite this mild phenotype, we were able to measure significant changes in motor behav- ior due to curcumin diet intervention. Of these gait changes, 3 parameters that are associated with PD-like symptoms were found to be abnormally elevated in control diet mice, and 6 months of curcumin diet intervention was sufficient to bring these parameters back into the normal range. In control diet mice, expression of Syn-GFP increased the variability in both stride length and stance width, which are the same gait parameters reported to increase in a toxin-induced mouse model of PD [21]. It would be interesting to examine curcumin diet in- tervention in the A53T and E46K α-synuclein point mutation mouse models that show more severe motor dysfunction and early mortality [27,28], at varying time points of disease progres- sion, to test whether curcumin treatment could halt or reverse these more severe neurodegen- erative phenotypes.
\n
\nWe measured a global increase in S129-P-α-synuclein in cortical presynaptic terminals in mice that were chronically and acutely treated with curcumin. With chronic curcumin treat- ment, this increase in phosphorylation was also present at Syn-GFP-positive terminals, while in acutely-treated mice we measured a decrease in S129-P at Syn-GFP-positive terminals. Combined, these data indicate that the effects of curcumin on phosphorylation of human Syn- GFP are differentially modulated over acute and chronic treatment time points, despite there being an overall increase in endogenous mouse S129-P for both acute and chronic curcumin exposure. With acute treatment, where S129-P-α-synuclein is decreased in terminals contain- ing human Syn-GFP but increased in terminals containing endogenous mouse α-synuclein, this could represent an effect of short-term curcumin treatment specifically on human α-synu- clein that is reversed with long-term exposure to curcumin. Human and mouse α-synuclein differ by only 7 amino acids and may functionally compensate for each other, but importantly, endogenous mouse protein contains a threonine at the 53 position that is associated with increased aggregation and toxicity in human patients [9]. It has been proposed that curcumin binds to amino acids 89–91 of α-synuclein [13]; thus if threonine-53 present in mouse protein is responsible for the differential effects of curcumin, it may occur through allosteric changes to the binding pocket. It is also possible that curcumin acts to increase mouse α-synuclein presyn- aptic terminal expression, which could result in an overall increase in S129-P staining. We did not measure mouse α-synuclein by IHC due to the relative lack of a high quality mouse-specific antibody, but we did find that there was no change in human Syn-GFP levels with acute or chronic treatment. It will also be interesting in future studies to determine which kinases and phosphatases are involved in modifying the presynaptic pool of α-synuclein at S129, and to de- termine if curcumin may be directly modulating activity of these enzymes to produce the changes that we have measured.
\nHow S129-P phosphorylation of α-synuclein affects aggregation and toxicity is currently under debate. Because S129-P-α-synuclein is highly correlated with disease progression and pathology, with up to 90% of α-synuclein in LBs containing this modification, S129-P has long been thought to be a marker of toxic forms of the protein [29,30]. However, recent evidence in- dicates that S129-P modification targets the protein for degradation via the autophagy path- way, and phosphorylation at this site was found to be neuro-protective both in vitro and in vivo [31]. We found that mice on a curcumin diet showed improvements in motor behavior as well as a global increase in S129-P in cortical pre-synaptic terminals, which supports the hy- pothesis that S129-P is protective in our synucleinopathy mouse model. The decrease in S129-P at Syn-GFP synapses after 2 weeks of curcumin treatment did not correlate with any changes in Syn-GFP terminal microaggregates, as measured by in vivo FRAP experiments and Proteinase-K digestion, indicating that longer time points of treatment may be needed to mea- sure a direct effect of curcumin on α-synuclein aggregation.
\n
\nThere are a number of possible mechanisms for how curcumin treatment increases S129-P- α-synuclein and improves motor behavior. Curcumin has been shown to increase proteasome activity and heat shock protein expression at low doses (up to 1 μM) in vitro, and to induce autophagic clearance of A-beta, which resulted in attenuated cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model [32,33]. Degradation of α-synuclein can occur through both proteasome and autophagy pathways, and S129-P has been shown to directly target α-synuclein for autophagic degradation to provide neuroprotection and motor improvement in another mouse model of PD [31,34]. There is also evidence that phosphomimic of S129 inhibits binding of pore-form- ing α-synuclein oligomers to membranes, thus conferring protection by blocking this form of toxic oligomers [35]. Thus curcumin’s action to increase α-synuclein phosphorylation may specifically promote its degradation via autophagy or proteasomal pathways, or by blocking the membrane-binding activity of toxic oligomers. Another possible mechanism involves direct disaggregation of α-synuclein by curcumin binding. Curcumin can directly bind to and disag- gregate both α-synuclein oligomers and fibrils in vitro, but phosphorylation state of the protein was not examined in those experiments [12,13]. Furthermore, the Syn-GFP microaggregates that we have previously characterized in these mice are not higher-order oligomers or fibrils, but instead exist as smaller aggregate species that are easily disaggregated into a single Syn- GFP band by SDS-PAGE analysis, consistent with this mouse being a model for early stages in the aggregate cascade [15]. We found no evidence that acute or chronic curcumin treatment modulates Proteinase K resistance of microaggregates in our mice, however FRAP experiments were only performed on acute curcumin treated mice. To test for a possible direct interaction between curcumin and Syn-GFP aggregates, further biochemical experiments would be neces- sary to characterize these aggregates, possibly by native western blot analysis or sequential SDS/Triton/Urea extraction. It would also be beneficial to use aggregate-specific antibodies, or antibodies to other post-translational modifications, to examine how curcumin may be modulating these different aggregate forms. For example, there is evidence that α-synuclein ag- gregates undergo nitration-based oxidative damage [36]. Curcumin is known to be a potent anti-oxidant and may be modulating α-synuclein, and ultimately motor behavior, by decreas- ing reactive oxygen species [11]. While further studies are needed to better understand the mo- lecular mechanisms underlying chronic curcumin diet intervention in synucleinopathy mouse models, our data demonstrate improvements in motor behavior, providing strong support for curcumin therapy as the subject of further pre-clinical studies.

\n# Abstract
\nWe previously identified a stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA), which induces differentiation of neural cells, including midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) dopaminergic neurons, from mouse embryonic stem cells. We report here that SDIA induces efficient neural differentiation also in primate embryonic stem cells. Induced neurons contain TH+ neurons at a frequency of 35% and produce a significant amount of dopamine. Interestingly, differentiation of TH+ neurons from undifferentiated embryonic cells occurs much faster in vitro (10 days) than it does in the embryo (≈5 weeks). In addition, 8% of the colonies contain large patches of Pax6+-pigmented epithelium of the retina. The SDIA method provides an unlimited source of primate cells for the study of pathogenesis, drug development, and transplantation in degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and retinitis pigmentosa.
\nInitiation of vertebrate neural differentiation in the embryonic ectoderm is triggered by inductive signals emanating from axial mesoderm (1, 2). In Xenopus, neural inducers from Spemann's organizer such as Noggin and Chordin play a major role in this process (3, 4). The neural inducers bind to and inactivate bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which suppresses neural differentiation of ectodermal cells and promotes epidermal differentiation. In Drosophila, Sog (fly homologue of Chordin) is a positive regulator of the initiation of central nervous system formation and antagonizes the activity of Dpp (fly BMP homologue), suggesting a conserved role of BMP and anti-BMP signals in neural determination across species (5).
\nIn amphibians, suppression of BMP signaling is proven to be essential and sufficient for neural induction in ectodermal tissues. In mammals, by contrast, very few experimental data have been available regarding the mechanisms underlying early neural differentiation. Recent studies have shown that attenuation of BMP signaling is essential, but not sufficient, for neural differentiation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Addition of BMP4 suppresses neural differentiation of ES cells both in floating culture (embryoid body) (6) and in substrate-attached cell culture (7). However, blockade of BMP signals by adding soluble BMP receptor–Fc chimera proteins or by overexpressing Chordin does not significantly promote neural differentiation of mouse ES cells, suggesting that some additional signaling is required for mammalian neural induction (7).
\nWe previously described a strong neuralizing activity present on the cell surface of stromal cells and named it SDIA (stromal cell-derived inducing activity) (7). In the absence of exogenous BMP4, mouse ES cells efficiently differentiate into neural precursors and neurons [>90% cells become neural cell adhesion molecule-positive (NCAM+)] when cultured on SDIA-possessing mouse stromal cells (PA6 cells) for a week. The SDIA method has several advantages in production of neurons as compared with previous embryoid body methods (8, 9). First, the SDIA method is technically simple. ES cells are grown in a flat culture from single cells into colonies. Second, neural differentiation of ES cells is not only efficient but also speedy; the postmitotic neuron marker TuJ (class III β-tubulin) appears on day 4–5. Finally (and most importantly), SDIA-treated ES cells differentiate into midbrain dopaminergic neurons at a high frequency; 30% of neurons derived from mouse ES cells are dopaminergic and produce significant amounts of dopamine. These cells survive at a reasonable rate (≈20%) 2 weeks after implantation in mouse striatum and extend dopaminergic neurites into the target tissue (7).
\nConsidering the usefulness in medical research, we have recently established pluripotent embryonic stem cell lines from blastocysts of Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey), which is commonly used in preclinical studies (10). ES cells derived from primate (human and monkey) blastocysts possess a number of characteristics distinct from mouse cells, such as surface antigens, leukemia inhibitory factor-independency, and long doubling times (10–14). In this study, we have tested the SDIA method with primate ES cells and investigated its potential application for producing medically useful cells.
\n
\n# Materials and Methods
\nMaintenance of Primate ES Cells. Cynomolgus monkey ES cell lines were established, and their pluripotency was confirmed by teratoma formation in severe combined immunodeficiency mice as described previously (10). Undifferentiated ES cells were maintained on a feeder layer of mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor/20% knockout serum replacement (GIBCO)/4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. Subculturing of ES cells was performed by using 0.25% trypsin in PBS with 20% knockout serum replacement and 1 mM CaCl2 as described (10).
\n
\nInduction of Neural Differentiation of Primate ES Cells. PA6 cells were plated on type I collagen-coated chamber slides (Falcon) or gelatin-coated dishes and used as a feeder cell layer (7, 15). To strictly avoid contamination by incidentally differentiating cells, we manually selected undifferentiated ES cell colonies with stem cell-like morphology (tightly packed cells with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio; see Fig. 1A). Undifferentiated ES cell colonies were first washed twice with GMEM medium supplemented with 10% knockout serum replacement/1 mM pyruvate/0.1 mM nonessential amino acids/0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (differentiation medium). After trypsinization for 5 min at 37°C, partially dissociated ES cell clumps (10–50 cells/one clump) were plated on PA6 cells at a density of 500 clumps/10-cm dish and cultured in the differentiation medium for 3 weeks or indicated periods. Medium was changed every third day. Unlike mouse ES cells, monkey ES cells do not form colonies from single cells on PA6 cells. Low cloning efficiency has been also reported for human ES cells (12–14). It is therefore necessary to plate clumps of 10–50 undifferentiated ES cells for starting induction. Two independent ES cell lines (CMK 6 and 9; normal karyotypes) were used and found to give similar results. In some experiments, 0.5 nM BMP4 (R & D Systems) was added to the differentiation medium on day 0 and at each medium change.

\n### Immunostaining
\nThe antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (NCAM/polyclonal/used in a dilution of 1:300, TH/polyclonal/1:100, NeuN/monoclonal/1:100, ChAT/polyclonal/1:20, peripherin/polyclonal/1:100, and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)/polyclonal/1:200), Diasorin (serotonin/polyclonal/1:1,000), DSHB (Islet-1/monoclonal/1:200, and SSEA-4/monoclonal/1:50), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (GAD/polyclonal/1:10), Babco (Richmond, CA) (TuJ1/polyclonal/1:600 and Pax6/polyclonal/1:500), and Medac (Wedel, Germany) (CCK-8/polyclonal/1:100). The specificity of these antibodies was tested by using appropriate tissues or cells as positive controls. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with primary antibodies. Localization of antigens was visualized by using secondary antibodies conjugated with FITC, Cy3, or horseradish peroxidase. FITC-phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes.
\nPositive colonies were defined as colonies containing positive cells regardless of population. To estimate the efficacy of the differentiation at the cell level, colonies were randomly selected, and the numbers of positive cells were counted after a 3-week differentiation period. The numbers of total cells were examined by using DAPI, YOYO-1 (Molecular Probe), or anti-human nuclei antibody (Chemicon; also recognizing monkey nuclei). When necessary, data are given as mean ± standard deviation obtained from at least three independent experiments.
\n
\n### Detection of Dopamine.
\nMonkey ES cells were cultured on a PA6 cell layer for 3 weeks and were incubated for 15 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution (3 ml/10-cm dish) containing 56 mM KCl to induce depolarization of neurons. Then, the media were stabilized with 0.1 mM EDTA and analyzed for dopamine by using HPLC with fluorescence detection as described previously (16). Results were validated by coelution with authentic substances.
\nRNA Analysis. Reverse transcriptase–PCR was performed as described previously (4). The primers used are as follows: Lmx1b, GCAGCGGCTGCATGGAGAAGATCGC and GGTTCTGAAACCAGACCTGGACCAC; Nurr1, CTCCCAGAGGGAACTGCACTTCG and CTCTGGAGTTAAGAAATCGGAGCTG; Nrp-1/Musashi1, CGAGCTCGACTCCAAAACAATTGACC and TCTACACGGAATTCGGGGAACTGGTA; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG and GGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGACTC. PCR products using these primers were confirmed by sequencing.
\n
\n###Culture of Pigmented Epithelium.
\nAfter monkey ES cells were cultured on a PA6 cell layer for 3 weeks, a patch of pigmented cells was mechanically isolated by using a 200-μl tip and plated on a fresh PA6 cell layer in differentiation medium or on a collagen I-coated dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. The pigmented cells grew reasonably fast in both cases and could be replated at least twice.
\n
\n###Sorting Neural Cells.
\nThe cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37°C, filtered with nylon mesh, spun down, and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA. After incubation with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD56 antibody (NKH-1, Beckman Coulter) for 20 min at 4°C, positive cells were sorted with FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Sorted cells were cultured on a laminine/poly-L-ornithine-coated dish and were immunostained with neural- and neuron-specific antibodies such as anti-NCAM (cytoplasmic domain) and TuJ, respectively.
\n
\n###Transplantation Experiment.
\nFor 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment, 6-week-old severe combined immunodeficiency mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and fixed on a stereotactic device (Narishige, Tokyo); 6-OHDA (8 mg/ml) was injected unilaterally with a glass needle at three sites into the striatum as described previously (7). SDIA-treated ES cells were implanted into the ipsilateral striatum 7 days after 6-OHDA injection. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. ES cells were cultured on PA6 cells for 3 weeks in differentiation medium. Differentiated ES colonies were detached en bloc from feeder cells by treatment with collagenase B (1 mg/ml) and DNase I (25 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. Clumps of differentiated ES cells were labeled with 5 μg/ml CM-DiI in PBS supplemented with 4 mg/ml glucose for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed twice with GMEM, and then suspended in GMEM. By using a blunt-ended 26G Hamilton syringe, 9 × 104 cells (containing 1 × 104 TH+neurons) were slowly injected into the striatum (A + 0.9, L + 2.0, V + 3.0) over a 3-min period. In controls, suspension medium was injected. Two weeks after the transplantation, recipients were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
\n
\n# Results and Discussion
\n### Induction of Neural Differentiation in Primate ES Cells on PA6 Cells.
\nThe monkey ES cell lines CMK 6 and 9 (10) used in this work express high levels of undifferentiated state-specific markers such as alkaline phosphatase and SSEA-4 (ES colonies are shown by arrows in Fig. 1 A–C) but not the pan-neural marker NCAM (data not shown), even after maintenance in culture for more than 6 months.
\nWe applied the SDIA method to primate ES cells with minor modifications (see Materials and Methods). After culture on PA6 cells for 2 weeks, extensive neurites were found in a majority of primate ES cell colonies (97 ± 3%, n = 78), which contained a large number of cells positive for NCAM (neural precursors and neurons, Fig. 1D) and postmitotic neurons positive for class III β-tubulin (TuJ) and NeuN markers (Fig. 1E). At the cellular level, 45 ± 13% of the SDIA-treated primate cells (n = 420) were NCAM-positive neural cells, and 25 ± 6% (n = 660) were TuJ-positive postmitotic neurons. When primate ES cells were cultured on a gelatin-coated dish without PA6, less than 1% of cells became NCAM+ (n = 530). Our previous study with mouse ES cells has shown that SDIA treatment induces NCAM and TuJ in 92% and 53% of mouse cells, respectively (7, 15), indicating that the efficiency of neural differentiation in primate ES cells by SDIA is about half of that in mouse cells. One possible influence on this neural/non-neural ratio might be the qualitative difference of the non-neural cells. Non-neural cells in the SDIA-treated primate colonies were mostly fast-growing E-cadherin-negative mesenchymal cells, whereas those in the murine colonies were slower growing E-cadherin-positive epithelial cells (unpublished observations).
\nWe next examined inhibitors of neural differentiation in primate cells. Our previous study with mouse ES cells has shown that BMP and serum inhibit neural differentiation of mouse cells (7). Similarly, addition of BMP4 (0.5 nM) or FBS (5%) efficiently suppressed neuronal differentiation in primate cells (Fig. 1F), suggesting that primate and mouse ES cells respond to the same positive (SDIA) and negative (BMP and serum) factors in neural differentiation.
\n
\n### Induction of Dopaminergic Neurons from Primate ES Cells.
\nSDIA has been reported to induce TH+dopaminergic neurons efficiently from mouse ES cells (7, 15). We therefore tested whether similar findings could be obtained with primate cells. After 2 weeks of induction, 80 ± 12% of the colonies contained TH+ cells (n = 40; Fig. 2A). At the cellular level, 35 ± 6% of the TuJ+ postmitotic neurons were TH-positive (n = 560; Fig.2B). Next, the amount of dopamine released upon depolarization was analyzed by HPLC assay (Fig. 2C). The SDIA-treated ES cells released 1.0 pmol/107 cells in response to high K+ depolarizing stimuli, indicating that they contain a significant number of functional dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 2C Lower; authentic substances in Fig. 2C Upper). In addition to dopamine, norepinephrine was also detected at the level of 0.5 pmol/107 cells. Consistently, 81% of TH+ neurons (28% of total neurons) were DBH-negative (dopaminergic neurons) on day 18, whereas the rest were DBH-positive (norepinephrinergic/epinephrinergic neurons) (n = 200) (Fig. 2D). The dopaminergic neurons induced by SDIA were CCK-negative (positive in A10 neuron; ref. 17) and GAD-negative (positive in olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons; ref. 18) (Fig. 2D). We next asked whether these TH+ neurons have characteristics of central nervous system or peripheral nervous system neurons. SDIA-induced TH+ neurons were negative for peripherin, which is a specific marker for PNS neurons (19) (n = 200; Fig. 2E). Further, reverse transcriptase–PCR analyses (Fig. 2F) showed that SDIA-induced neurons expressed midbrain dopaminergic neuron markers, such as Nurr1 and Lmx1b (20), whereas neither undifferentiated ES cells nor feeder cells did.
\n
\nWe next implanted SDIA-treated primate ES cells into the mouse striatum by the stereotaxic method. The striatum is a target nucleus of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and contains dopaminergic fibers but not cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons. SDIA-treated primate ES cells containing 1 × 104 TH+ neurons were grafted into the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse striatum from which dopaminergic fibers were depleted by 6-OHDA treatment as described previously (7). Two weeks after implantation (Fig. 2G), 8.3 ± 3.2% of implanted TH+ neurons (arrows, cell bodies) survived and extended neurites (arrowheads) in the tissue. This value is roughly comparable to that in the previous mouse study (7). We are currently attempting implantation into the monkey brain to evaluate long-term survival of primate TH+ neurons.
\n
\n## Temporal Regulation of Primate Neural Differentiation.
\nThe time required for fetal development varies significantly among different mammalian species. The gestation period of mice is 20 days, whereas that of M. fascicularis is 160 days. This large difference in time (8-fold) resides mainly in the lengths of the organogenetic and the fetal periods rather than in the early embryonic period.
\nWe therefore examined temporal regulation of neuronal makers during SDIA-induced neural differentiation in primate and mouse ES cells. The neural precursor marker Nrp-1/Musashi1 (21) was detected on day 4 and onward both in primate and mouse cells by reverse transcriptase–PCR analyses (data not shown). Next, temporal expression profiles of NCAM (pan-neural) and TuJ (neuronal) markers were analyzed by immunostaining as shown in Fig. 3 A and B, respectively (closed, primate cells; open, mouse cells). The expression of NCAM and TuJ took 1–3 days and 3–5 days longer in primate cells than in murine cells. TH+cells (Fig. 3C) first appeared on day 10 in the primate colonies, whereas the onset of TH+ cell generation in the murine colonies was between days 5–7.
\n
\nThe genesis of midbrain TH+ neurons occurs during the organogenetic period. TH+ neurons first appear in the murine midbrain on E10.5–11.5 (22, 23). In mice, the number of days required for dopaminergic neuron differentiation by SDIA in vitro (7 days) is roughly the same as that for in vivo genesis of TH+ neurons from the inner cell mass (7–8 days) (ref. 7 and Fig. 3C). In Macaca, TH+ neurons are reported to first appear about 5 weeks after implantation (24). By contrast, in vitro induction of TH+ neurons from primate ES cells by SDIA took only 10–12 days (Fig. 3C), showing that primate TH+ neurons differentiate from undifferentiated embryonic cells much faster in vitro than in vivo. One explanation might be that the speed of cell differentiation is actively reduced in primate embryos to allow sufficient numbers of precursor cells to accumulate for construction of the large primate brain. Regardless of the reason, in practice, the SDIA-based approach carries the advantage of requiring less time to produce dopaminergic neurons than had been expected from the in vivo time course.
\n
\n## Other Neuronal Markers Induced in SDIA-Treated Primate ES Cells.
\nWe next examined characteristics of TH-negative neurons induced by SDIA with various markers (Fig. 4). In addition to TH+neurons, the SDIA-treated primate ES cells gave rise to GAD-positive (GABAergic; 20 ± 8% of postmitotic neurons), ChAT-positive (cholinergic; 5 ± 3%), and 5HT-positive (serotonergic; 1 ± 0.5%) neurons (n = 300). The proportion of transmitter profiles is similar to that found with SDIA-treated mouse ES cells (7). Interestingly, neurons positive for Islet-1 (marker of motoneurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons) were found in primate cells (5 ± 3%, n = 160) and in mouse cells (10–15%; K.M., H.K., and Y.S., unpublished results).
\n
\n## Generation of Pigmented Epithelial Cells from Primate ES Cells.
\nOne unexpected finding from the primate study was the appearance of epithelial cells with massive pigmentation, which was rarely observed in SDIA-treated mouse ES cells or in primate ES cells cultured on the collagen-coated dish (unpublished observations). After culture on PA6 cells for 3 weeks, large patches of pigmented cells were present in 8 ± 4% of the primate ES cell colonies (n = 200; Fig. 5A) and grew at a constant rate on the feeder cells. The polygonal morphology with a compact cell–cell arrangement (Fig. 5B) was reminiscent of the pigmented epithelium of the eye (25) and clearly distinct from pigmented melanocytes derived from neural crest (26). Further, phalloidin staining showed polygonal “actin bundles” typical for pigmented epithelium (Fig. 5C) (27), rather than the “stress fiber” actin staining found in neural crest-derived pigment cells (28). From an ontogenic view, the pigmented epithelium of the eye is a derivative of the diencephalon and has the same origin (optic cup) as the neural retina. Consistently, pigmented epithelial cells from primate ES cells were positive for the optic cup marker Pax6 (reviewed in ref. 29) (Fig. 5D). These cells could be easily isolated manually under a dissecting microscope with a pipetman tip and expanded to confluency on PA6 cells as a feeder layer or on a collagen-coated dish without feeder cells (Fig. 5E; see Materials and Methods).
\nThe pigmented epithelium of the eye is a target tissue of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Therefore, the availability of primate pigmented epithelia generated in vitro should facilitate the pathogenetic and therapeutic studies of this retinal degenerative disease (30, 31). Also, because pigmented epithelia are derived from the optic cup, the SDIA method with modifications offers the potential to generate neural retinal cells such as photoreceptor cells in the future.
\n
\n## Application of Dopaminergic Neurons Derived from Primate ES Cells.
\nIn this report, we have shown that primate cells are successfully coaxed to differentiate into neural cells by the SDIA method. Although the percentage of neural cells in primate cell colonies is about half of that in mouse ones (45% vs. 92% as discussed above), this may be partially compensated by selective sorting. Using single-step FACS purification with the neural-specific surface antigen CD56 as a selection marker, SDIA–induced neural cells can be enriched by ≈2-fold, i.e., to the purity of 90% NCAM+ and 54% TuJ+ (unpublished data; see Materials and Methods). Also, neural precursor cells may be enriched by using a combination of other surface-sorting markers shown in recent studies, such as CD133+, CD45−, CD34−, CD24low, and PNAlow (32, 33).
\nThe ability to produce primate dopaminergic neurons by this simple in vitro preparation should greatly facilitate research in numerous areas of Parkinson's disease therapeutics (34–36). For instance, monkey dopaminergic neurons provide good in vitro systems for drug screening concerning the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons and for toxicity testing of substances potentially harmful to dopaminergic neurons, such as rotenone (37). This approach can be modified to a semi in vivo system by grafting these neurons into the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse brain. Also, primate dopaminergic neurons prepared by this method can be used to raise monoclonal antibodies against dopaminergic neuron-specific surface antigens for sorting.
\nOur present and previous (7) works have demonstrated that SDIA can induce dopaminergic neuron differentiation from murine and non-human primate ES cells. Considering the close phylogenetic relationship between humans and Macaca (both belong to the family of Catarrhini, the suborder of Anthropoidea), it is expected that the SDIA method should be applicable to the generation of dopaminergic neurons also from human ES cells. Over the last decade, a number of clinical efforts have been made for neuronal transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease (38). Grafting fetal midbrain tissues into the striatum significantly improves motor disorders in a substantial number of cases. The bottleneck of this therapeutic strategy has been the supply of neurons along with the accompanying ethical issues. The SDIA-based approach offers a practical alternative to brain tissues from aborted fetuses. As a first step toward this goal, we are planning to perform therapeutic studies by implanting primate dopaminergic neurons generated by SDIA into the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkey brain. At the level of efficacy shown in the present work (where dopaminergic neurons occupy 28% of postmitotic neurons, which are 25% of total cells), ≈5 × 107 total cells are necessary to successfully implant 3 × 105 dopaminergic cells (an expected therapeutic dose for neural grafting) (38), given that the survival rate after grafting is 8%. This indicates that only a dozen culture dishes are needed for one transplantation, demonstrating the practical feasibility of this approach.
\nIn conclusion, the SDIA method is a promising approach that brings stem cell therapy for Parkinson's disease toward the practical level.

\n### Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are associated with abnormal neuronal aggregation of  -synuclein. However, the mechanisms of aggregation and their relationship to disease are poorly understood. We developed an in vivo multiphoton imaging paradigm to study  -synuclein aggregation in mouse cortex with subcellular resolution. We used a green fluorescent protein-tagged human  -synuclein mouse line that has moderate overexpression levels mimicking human disease. Fluorescence recovery after photo- bleaching (FRAP) of labeled protein demonstrated that somatic  -synuclein existed primarily in an unbound, soluble pool. In contrast,  -synuclein in presynaptic terminals was in at least three different pools: (1) as unbound, soluble protein; (2) bound to presynaptic vesicles; and (3) as microaggregates. Serial imaging of microaggregates over 1 week demonstrated a heterogeneous population with differing  -synuclein exchange rates. The microaggregate species were resistant to proteinase K, phosphorylated at serine-129, oxidized, and associated with a decrease in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin and glutamate immunogold labeling. Multiphoton FRAP provided the specific binding constants for  -synuclein’s binding to synaptic vesicles and its effective diffusion coefficient in the soma and axon, setting the stage for future studies targeting synuclein modifications and their effects. Our in vivo results suggest that, under moderate overexpression conditions,  -synuclein aggregates are selectively found in presynaptic terminals.
\n
\n## Introduction
\n
\nAlpha-synuclein is a 140 aa protein localized to vertebrate pre- synaptic terminals. Although its exact function is unclear,  -synuclein binds synaptic vesicle membranes and likely assists vesicle trafficking and SNARE complex formation (Goedert, 2001; Norris et al., 2004; Rizo and Sudhof, 2012). Increases in  -synuclein levels lead to its abnormal aggregation and neuronal degeneration both in vitro (Zach et al., 2007; Outeiro et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010) and in vivo (Masliah et al., 2000; Giasson et al., 2002; Emmer et al., 2011). For example, multiplication muta- tions that increase expression levels by 50–100% cause Parkin- son’s disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; Singleton et al., 2003; Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004). Interestingly, these mutations are also associated with Lewy bodies and neurites, identi- cal to the more common sporadic forms of these diseases (Farrer et al., 2004). Because aggregated  -synuclein is the principal component of Lewy pathology, these observations strongly sug- gest that  -synuclein aggregation is a critical factor in the etiology of genetic and sporadic PD and DLB. Although much is known about factors that promote  -synuclein aggregation in vitro, in- cluding posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation (Fujiwara et al., 2002), oxidization (Hashimoto et al., 1999), and particular point mutations (Conway et al., 1998), how these fac- tors relate to aggregation in vivo is less well understood.
\n
\nIn cell culture, overexpression of human  -synuclein in hip- pocampal neurons leads to its presynaptic aggregation (Scott et al., 2010) and deficits in neurotransmitter release (Nemani et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2010). However, examination of  -synuclein aggregation in living brain tissue has been limited. To determine binding and aggregation properties of  -synuclein in vivo, we adapted multiphoton fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) paradigms developed for studying fluorescent species in vitro (Brown et al., 1999; Mazza et al., 2008; Schnell et al., 2008; Sullivan and Brown, 2010) for in vivo studies of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged human  alpha-synuclein (Syn-GFP) in mouse cortex using cranial windows (Unni et al., 2010). Using the Syn- GFP transgenic mouse line and in vivo multiphoton imaging, we characterized in vivo Syn-GFP FRAP in mouse cortex and dem- onstrated that it is an accurate way to measure protein mobility. Under conditions of moderate  -synuclein overexpression (2- to 3-fold), levels similar to those seen in patients with multiplication mutations, the somatic Syn-GFP pool was entirely soluble and freely diffusible. In contrast, presynaptic Syn-GFP existed in at least three different pools, one of which was soluble and freely diffusible, whereas the other two had decreasing levels of mobil- ity. Binding constant measurements for  alpha-synuclein’s association and dissociation with presynaptic vesicles and its effective diffu- sion coefficient in different subcellular compartments in vivo suggest potentially important tools for future studies of the human-disease-associated point mutations (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997; Kru ̈ger et al., 1998; Zarranz et al., 2004). Our results demonstrate that in vivo multiphoton FRAP is a powerful tool for studies of protein aggregation and binding in living mouse brain and that, under moderate overexpression conditions mimicking human disease,  alpha-synuclein aggregation is selectively found at presynaptic terminals in vivo and is potentially related to their dysfunction.

\n## Materials and Methods
\n
\nAnimals. Syn-GFP (PDNG78; Rockenstein et al., 2005) heterozygous male mice were mated to BDF1 females from Charles River Labora- tories and housed by Oregon Health and Science University’s (OHSU’s) Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM). Thy1-GFP M-line animals were used for GFP-only control experiments. Animals were held in a light-dark cycle, temperature- and humidity- controlled animal vivarium and maintained under ad libitum food and water diet supplied by the DCM. All experiments were approved by the OHSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Animals between 1 and 18 months old were used, as specified in the text. Male and female mice were analyzed separately, but no significant differences were noted so combined results for both sexes are reported.
\nCranial window surgery and in vivo imaging. Cranial window sur- gery, in vivo imaging, and photobleaching were done similarly to previously published protocols (Unni et al., 2010). Briefly, isoflurane (1–2%)-anesthetized animals were placed in a custom-built stereo- taxic frame and surgery was performed to create an  5-mm-diameter circular craniotomy overlying primary sensory and motor cortex, which was closed with an 8-mm-diameter coverglass and a custom- built aluminum fixation bar cemented into place. On imaging days, isoflurane-anesthetized animals were mounted again into the stereo- taxic frame and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 7MP multiphoton micro- scope outfitted with dual channel BiG (binary GaAsP) detectors and the Coherent Technologies Chameleon titanium-sapphire femtosec- ond pulsed laser source (tuned to 860 nm). Zeiss Zen 2011 image acquisition software was used for all in vivo imaging. Baseline images of Syn-GFP-labeled pyramidal-shaped neurons and presynaptic ter- minals in cortical layers 2/3 were taken using 1–3 mW power (mea- sured at objective exit). Square, circular, or line regions of interest (ROI) were used for photobleaching, with bleach times  5 ms and  100 –150 mW power (measured at objective exit). Immediately af- ter photobleaching, images were acquired to follow the recovery time course of fluorescence using the baseline settings. For chronic synapse imaging experiments, animals were remounted into the stereotaxic frame and cortical surface blood vessel patterns and Syn-GFP- positive cell body profiles were used to reidentify previously imaged terminals.
\nImaging analysis. Images were analyzed with ImageJ or Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012) to obtain mean fluorescence values in rele- vant ROIs over time. FRAP data were then analyzed in Prism 5 (GraphPad) to obtain single exponential fits to the recovery time course and the immobile and mobile fractions. Calculations of the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) of Syn-GFP and bleach depth parameter   were made by fitting FRAP recovery curves using the least-squares curve fitting routine “lsqcurvefit” in MATLAB R2013a (The MathWorks) to previously established models for two-photon FRAP recovery kinetics in the soma (equation 8, Schnell et al., 2008) or in the axon (equation 1, Schmidt et al., 2007). Measurements of the bleaching radial and axial radii ( r and  z) needed for this fitting were made by photobleaching fixed tissue cortical sections from Syn-GFP mice using the same settings as used for the in vivo FRAP experiments. To check for possible excitation saturation during bleaching in our system, the bleach depth parameter   was measured as a function of bleaching laser power. This relationship was linear throughout the bleach power ranges used (data not shown), indicating the absence of excitation saturation.
\n
\nGiven that the immobile fraction of Syn-GFP present at terminals did not exchange with other Syn-GFP pools on the time scale of  24 h (see below), we calculated the fraction of free Syn-GFP available for binding to vesicles as the ratio of the amplitude of the fast-recovering component (tau  100 ms) over the sum of the amplitudes of the fast component and the next slower component (tau  2.6 min, repre- senting the vesicle-bound fraction, see below). This free fraction is equal to koff/(kon*   koff), where koff is the first-order “off” rate con- stant of Syn-GFP unbinding from vesicles and kon* is the pseudo- first-order “on” rate constant for Syn-GFP binding to vesicles, assuming a constant concentration of vesicle-binding sites on this time scale. This equivalency can be used to derive the ratio kon*/koff. Given that diffusion is much faster than the binding event, we fitted the slower component terminal FRAP recovery curves to an estab- lished model for extracting koff values (Sprague et al., 2004) and could then calculate kon*. To determine the relationship between the immo- bile fraction and total Syn-GFP present at a synapse, we developed a metric for assessing total Syn-GFP by comparing the prebleach inten- sity of a particular synapse to the whole distribution of terminal intensities, which is positively skewed and invariant in shape between animals and at different ages (Unni et al., 2010). This “synapse posi- tion” or “Sp” number was calculated for each bleached synapse by comparing the mean prebleach intensity of that synapse to the mode in the synapse intensity distribution as measured by the number of Sp units by which it was brighter than the mode. One Sp unit is defined as the distance between the mode intensity and the point where the mode intensity had decreased by 90%. This metric has the advantage of comparing terminal intensities with the internal distribution from which they are drawn, which was stable between animals (Unni et al., 2010) and therefore useful for comparisons between animals for which absolute measured intensity values vary. For chronic terminal imaging, individual bleached synapse intensities were normalized to the average of the same two to four unbleached terminals in the field on multiple imaging days to control for possible differences in imag- ing conditions present on different days.
\n
\nMouse brain removal, fixation, and sectioning. Whole brains were dis- sected from mice and the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs removed. Brains were divided into two along the midsagittal plane. Both hemi- spheres were placed in plastic scintillation vials with 4% paraformal- dehyde and fixed for 1 h, 150 W, at 30°C using a BioWave (Pelco) microwave fixation system. Hemispheres were postfixed in 4% para- formaldehyde overnight at 4°C and then stored in PBS containing sodium azide (0.05%). Fixed hemispheres were mounted on a Leica VT1000 S Vibratome and sagittally sectioned into 50  m slices. Slices were stored in PBS containing sodium azide at 4°C.
\n
\nProteinase K digestion. Tissue sections were washed 3 times in PBS to remove azide and then incubated in 0.05% SDS in PBS   10  g/ml proteinase K (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h at 37°C in the dark with shaking. Alternatively, free floating tissue sections were wet mounted on a slide using a Pap pen and incubated   10  g/ml proteinase K in 0.05% SDS/PBS for 5 min at 60°C in a dark, humidified chamber on a hot plate. Sections were washed 3 times, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal mi- croscope. For each condition, four cortical z-stack sections per animal for three animals were imaged and fluorescence was quantified for individual cell bodies and synapses using Fiji. Whole mouse brain was prepared for Western blot analysis via use of Syn-PER Synaptic Pro- tein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher), resulting in both a functional synaptosome fraction and a cytosolic fraction. Equal volumes of each fraction were then incubated with a 1:1 ratio of proteinase K stock solution (1 mg/ml proteinase K, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM CaCl, 50% glycerol in PBS) for 30 min at 37°C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of Novex Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subsequently heated to 95°C for 10 min. Samples were run on a 4 –12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) for 2 h and 45 min at 80 V. Gels were transferred onto Immobilon-FL membranes (0.45  m pore; Millipore) at 25 V for 18 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were probed with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4°C at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer. IR800 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Li-Cor) was used at a 1:15,000 dilution. Blot fluorescence was measured with a LI-COR Odyssey CLx and images analyzed using Image Studio software. The proteinase K-resistant fraction was measured as the ratio of treated versus untreated integrated band intensity.
\n
\nImmunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. Two anti- -synuclein antibodies were used, mouse monoclonal Syn303 (Covance) raised against oxidized  -synuclein species and rabbit monoclonal pSyn (Abcam) raised against serine-129 phosphorylated  -synuclein. Rab- bit anti-synapsin polyclonal antibody (Novex) was used to detect the synaptic vesicle protein synapsin 1 and mouse anti- -synuclein monoclonal antibody Syn1 (BD Biosciences) was used to detect mouse and human  -synuclein. Then 50  m fixed brain slices were washed 3 times in PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% Triton-X, 10% goat serum) for 2 h while shaking in the dark. Primary antibodies were used at 3  g/ml for Syn303 and 1.5  g/ml for pSyn in a 1:5 dilution of blocking buffer and incubated with shaking in the dark overnight at 4°C. Tissue was washed in PBS 5 times for 30 min each. Secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) were diluted to 1:2000 and subjected to incu- bated shaking in the dark overnight at 4°C. Tissue was washed in PBS 5 times for 30 min each at room temperature. Brain slices were mounted on slides in CFM-2 (Ted Pella), sealed with CoverGrip (Bi- otium), and allowed to dry overnight in the dark. Synapsin (0.4  g/ ml) and Syn1 (0.5  g/ml) staining was performed using microwave- assisted immunohistochemistry as described previously (Ferris et al., 2009) with a modified primary antibody incubation step of 12 min (4 on, 4 off, 4 on), followed by a 5 min rest step to increase antibody binding. For confocal imaging, sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63 /1.40 oil objective. Laser powers of 1–5% were used to acquire z-stacks through 2– 4 regions of cortex per tissue section. Fluorescence images were analyzed in Fiji, ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop, with only linear scaling of the pixel values. To quantify colocalization at synapses, we used the CoLoc parameter in Imaris data analysis software with a GFP fluorescence threshold of 0.1% to limit the analysis to only synapses and an antibody fluorescence threshold of 5% fluorescence.

\nElectron microscopy and glutamate immunogold analysis. Electron microscopy (EM) and glutamate immunogold analysis were done similarly to previously published protocols (Walker et al., 2012). An- imals were perfused using a transcardiac approach with 0.5% para- formaldehyde/1% glutaraldehyde/0.1% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature. The primary sensory and motor cortex was processed for EM pre-embed diaminobenzidine (DAB) immunolabeling for localization of GFP (GFP rabbit polyclonal anti- body, 1:1000; Fitzgerald) using a microwave procedure. Tissue was incubated in the microwave (Pelco BioWave; Ted Pella) for 5 min, 550 W, at 35°C with the vacuum off (all the remaining steps occurred at this temperature) in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0 (antigen retrieval), rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 2   1 min at 150 W with the vacuum off, exposed to 3% hydrogen peroxide at 150 W for 1 min with the vacuum on, rinsed in PB at 150 W for 2   1 min with the vacuum off, exposed to 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, 550 W with the vacuum on, washed in PB for 2   1 min at 200 W with the vacuum off, then exposed to the primary antibody for 12 min at 200 W 4 times using the following cycle: 2 min on, 2 min off, 2 min on, 5 min off, all on a continuous vacuum. The tissue is then rinsed in PB twice at 1 min each at 150 W with the vacuum off, and then exposed to the secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, 1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 15 min at 200 W for 2 cycles of the following: 4 min on, 3 min off, 4 min on, 5 min off, all on a continuous vacuum. The tissue is then rinsed in PB, 2   1 min, at 150 W with the vacuum off and then exposed to ABC (Vector Elite Kit, 1  l/ml solution A and B in PB) for 11 min at 150 W under vacuum using the following cycle: 4 min on, 3 min off, 4 min on. The tissue was then rinsed in PB twice at 1 min each, at 150 W with the vacuum off and then exposed to DAB (0.5  g/ml   1.5% hydrogen peroxide) for up to 10 min at room temperature.

\nPostembedding immunogold electron microscopy was performed us- ing a glutamate antibody (non-affinity-purified, rabbit polyclonal; Sigma). Thin sections (60 nm) were cut on an ultramicrotome (EM UC7; Leica) along the leading edge of the cortical tissue block, where layers I-VI were exposed, using a diamond knife (Diatome). The primary glutamate antibody, as described previously (Phend et al., 1992), was diluted 1:250 in TBST 7.6 and aspartate (1 mM) was added to the glutamate antibody mixture 24 h before incubation with the thin-sectioned tissue to prevent any cross-reactivity with aspartate within the tissue. The secondary anti- body was goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; diluted 1:25 in TBST, pH 8.2) tagged with 12 nm gold particles. We previously reported that incubation of the antibody with 3 mM glutamate resulted in no immunogold labeling, showing the specificity of the glutamate labeling (Meshul et al., 1994). Photographs (10/animal) were taken on a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope of Syn-GFP-labeled and Syn- GFP-unlabeled terminals from a single 50 mesh grid (1 thin section/grid, 1 photograph/grid square) throughout the neuropil (an area containing the highest numbers of synapses) of layers II and III at a final magnifica- tion of 40,000  by an individual blinded to the experimental groups, using a digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). For all Syn- GFP-immunolabeled terminals and non-Syn-GFP-labeled terminals, the density of immunogold labeling was determined in each terminal at the ages mentioned.
\nFor quantification of glutamate labeling, the number of immuno- gold particles located within or at least touching the synaptic vesicle membrane (i.e., vesicular pool), the number located outside the syn- aptic vesicles (i.e., the cytoplasmic pool), and those associated with mitochondria were counted. The vesicular and cytoplasmic pools were combined because the cytoplasmic pool is very small ( 10%) compared with the vesicular pool (Meshul et al., 1999). We have reported that nerve terminals making a symmetrical contact contain GABA (Meshul et al., 1999), the precursor for which is glutamate. Therefore, nerve terminals making a symmetrical contact will natu- rally contain some glutamate immunolabeling and cannot be consid- ered immunonegative as a way of determining a ratio between glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals (Meshul et al., 1994, 1999). The metabolic pool is also relatively small and thus unlikely to be a major source of variation in labeling intensity. The density of gold particles per square micrometer of nerve terminal area was deter- mined for each animal and the mean density for each group calcu- lated. Background labeling was determined within glial cell processes and was found to be 10 immunogold-labeled particles per square micrometer (Meshul et al., 1994). This was subtracted from the den- sity of presynaptic immunogold-labeled glutamate within the nerve terminals.

\n## Results
\n
\nSomatic  -synuclein exists in a single soluble pool
\nTo measure potential fast dynamics of Syn-GFP within the cell bodies of layer 2/3 primary sensory and motor cortex neurons in our mice, we performed a series of FRAP experiments in line scan mode that allowed us to acquire recovery data with a time reso- lution of up to 1 ms. Syn-GFP demonstrated a fast recovery tau that was well fit by a single exponential (23.4   7.4 ms, n   7 cells, 4 animals; Fig. 1 A, B), similar to recovery in a different mouse line expressing soluble, monomeric GFP within cortical neurons (26.7   8.2 ms, n   12 cells, 2 animals, p   0.40; Fig. 1 A, B). This suggests that somatic Syn-GFP, like free GFP, exists predominantly in a soluble, freely diffusible state without appreciable binding to somatic membranous compartments. We also mea- sured FRAP recovery curves for Syn-GFP using square ROIs to estimate Deff in vivo. Square ROIs were used because this simpli- fies the assessment of model parameters needed for estimating Deff. We fit recovery curves using established methods for extract- ing Deff from multiphoton FRAP data (Brown et al., 1999; Schnell et al., 2008; Sullivan and Brown, 2010; Fig. 1C) to calculate the in vivo Deff of Syn-GFP (see Materials and Methods). The in vivo Deff for somatic Syn-GFP was 8.6   3.8  m2/s (n   14 cells, 4 ani- mals), which was somewhat less than predicted for a soluble, monomeric Syn-GFP fusion protein ( 13–34  m2/s) based on the molecular weight of the fusion protein and Deff of cytoplasmic GFP in cultured cells (Yokoe and Meyer, 1996; Arrio-DuPont et al., 2000; Sprague et al., 2004;  15– 40  m 2/s).
\n
\n## In vivo FRAP accurately measures  -synuclein mobility in mouse cortex
\n
\nOur previous work suggested that FRAP could be a useful tool for studying mechanisms of  -synuclein aggregation in the living mouse brain on the time scale of minutes (Unni et al., 2010). However, to assess FRAP recovery of Syn-GFP on a millisecond time scale, one must consider the possibility of reversible dark state recovery of GFP. In addition to irreversible GFP photo- bleaching, under certain conditions, photobleaching GFP temporarily converts it into a reversible “dark state” (Swaminathan et al., 1997; Mueller et al., 2012) that recovers on the order of hun- dreds of microseconds to milliseconds.
\n
\nWe performed several experiments to test for possible dark state recovery. In FRAP experiments in which signal recovery is dominated by protein movement from unbleached regions into the bleached region, recovery will be slower with larger bleach ROIs. In contrast, reversible dark state recovery of GFP involves an intramolecular reaction that is independent of the size of the bleached area (Swaminathan et al., 1997). Therefore, we bleached different-sized ROIs within the same neuron sequentially, mea- suring the rate of recovery for each bleach size (Fig. 2A). Syn-GFP FRAP showed a slower recovery tau when a 4-fold larger bleach area was compared with the smaller bleach area (mean tau ratio large ROI/small ROI   1.79, 95% confidence interval   1.41– 2.16, range   1.03–3.02, n   13 cells, 4 animals; Fig. 2B). A plot of the absolute recovery tau versus bleach area also showed a signif- icant positive correlation, as expected for movement of un- bleached Syn-GFP into the bleached area (r 2   0.38, p   0.001, n   26, 4 animals; Fig. 2C). Finally, we saw no recovery of Syn- GFP FRAP in fixed tissue sections of cortex (data not shown). Dark state recovery of GFP can occur in fixed tissue (Mueller et al., 2012) in which protein movement on the micron scale is precluded, strongly suggesting that the rapid recovery of somatic Syn-GFP FRAP signal that we measured represents true protein movement within neurons.
\n
\n## Presynaptic terminal  -synuclein exists in at least three different pools, each with different mobility
\n
\nTo measure Syn-GFP mobility in vivo within presynaptic termi- nals, as defined as fluorescent neuropil puncta (Unni et al., 2010), we used FRAP in line scan mode. Unlike the soma, individual terminals showed slower recovery that was not well fit by a single exponential. The fastest component in terminals was well fit by a single exponential with a tau of 102   51 ms (n   11 synapses, 4 animals; Fig. 3A). This component comprised only 23   9% of total terminal Syn-GFP. In contrast, bleaching of free GFP in presynaptic terminals recovered completely with a tau of 122   62 ms (n   9 synapses, 2 animals, p   0.43, t test; Fig. 3B). This suggests that only a small fraction of Syn-GFP in presynaptic terminals is soluble and freely diffusible. Although the rate of recovery for the fast component in presynaptic terminals was slower than the soma, this difference is likely due to geometrical barriers to diffusion present in thin axonal processes rather than binding interactions. Further support for this idea came from measuring Deff in the axonal compartment using multiphoton FRAP recovery (Schmidt et al., 2007) compared with the mea- sured value of Deff in the soma. Measuring axonal Deff in this way requires assuming one-dimensional diffusion along thin axonal processes, which was validated for parvalbumin in axons of cer- ebellar Purkinje neurons in acute slices (Schmidt et al., 2007). We measured an axonal Deff for Syn-GFP of 9.0   6.6  m 2/s (n   11 synapses, 3 animals; Fig. 3C,D), which was very similar to the measured Deff in the soma (8.6   3.8  m 2/s, p   0.85, t test; Fig. 3D). This similarity suggests that a portion of terminal Syn-GFP is freely diffusible and that the one-dimensional diffusion ap- proximation for soluble protein mobility in the axon is valid in vivo, as it is in slices (Schmidt et al., 2007). Although measure- ments from small axonal processes potentially suffer from lower signal-to-noise levels, our data show that multiphoton imaging provides high-quality data from even these small volume struc- tures. A rough estimate of the magnitude of the constraint that axonal geometry places on the diffusion of a soluble protein of this size in vivo can be made by taking the ratio of the recovery tau measured using line scan FRAP in the presynaptic terminal and the soma, which demonstrates a  5-fold slower recovery in the axonal compartment.
\n
\nUsing FRAP with circular ROIs encompassing individual terminals (Unni et al., 2010), we measured two additional components of Syn-GFP recovery, one well fit by a single ex- ponential recovery tau of 2.6   2.5 min (n   22 synapses, 7 animals) comprising 45   21% of total terminal Syn-GFP (n   19 synapses, 5 animals; Fig. 4 A, B). The remaining 32   21% of total terminal Syn-GFP (n   19 synapses, 5 animals) did not recover over the course of 10 min, comprising essen- tially an immobile fraction (IF) on this time scale. In contrast, circular ROI bleaching studies of individual terminals in GFP transgenic animals demonstrated a much faster recovery tau of 5.1   3.7 s (n   6 synapses, 2 animals), consistent with a homogenous population of soluble GFP. The recovery of sol- uble GFP was slower than in our line scan experiments, likely because of differences in bleach area and time when using the two different bleach ROI conditions. The IF of Syn-GFP in each terminal (ranged from 0 to 83%) and was correlated with the total amount of Syn-GFP present before bleaching (r2   0.26, p   0.03, n   19 synapses, 5 animals; Fig. 4C), suggesting that synapses with greater Syn-GFP have more immobilized protein. In contrast, there was no correlation between the recovery tau and IF size at each synapse (r 2   0.001, p   0.89, n   19 synapses, 5 animals). Next we used a slightly modified technique that bleached a larger square area ROI (53 53  m 2) encompassing 50 –100 terminals simultaneously. This allowed us to measure FRAP recovery data on a pooled group of synapses more efficiently to get better estimates of the pop- ulation as opposed to bleaching each terminal one-by-one. The terminal recovery parameters measured in this way were indistinguishable from our individual terminal bleaching ex- periments (individual terminal FRAP recovery tau   2.6   2.5 min, n   22 synapses, 7 animals; area FRAP recovery tau   1.9   1.3 min, n   78,652  m2, 9 animals; t test p   0.47; individual terminal FRAP IF   42   21%, n   19 synapses, 5 animals; area FRAP IF   49   11%, n   78,652  m2, 9 ani- mals; t test p   0.42). Using this approach, we measured FRAP parameters from animals of different ages, including 1, 3–6, and 12–18 months of age (1 month IF: 45   10%, 3– 6 month IF: 48   1%, 12–18 month IF: 55   17%, one-way ANOVA p   0.62; Fig. 4D; 1 month tau: 1.2   0.9 min, 3– 6 month tau: 1.8   1.0 min, 12–18 month tau: 2.8   1.4 min, one-way ANOVA p   0.18; Fig. 4E; n   3 animals per age group). Interestingly, the IF and recovery tau values measured did not vary significantly over this age range. Using the percent free and vesicle-bound Syn-GFP in the ter- minal, the ratio of free/(free   vesicle bound) Syn-GFP was 34   17%. Assuming a simple second-order binding reaction for asso- ciation of Syn-GFP with vesicles (see Materials and Methods), we calculated the ratio of kon*/koff to be 1.96   1.10 in vivo. This calculation assumes a constant concentration of vesicle binding sites on this time scale. Given that diffusion is fast compared with the binding rate, we used established FRAP analysis methods (Sprague et al., 2004) to obtain koff   6.47   3.74   10 3 sec 1 and kon*   12.7   10.2   10 3 sec 1.
\n
\nLong-term imaging of individual bleached Syn-GFP-positive terminals over the time scale of several hours to 1 week revealed that there was no further recovery of FRAP signal after the first several minutes or over the course of 1–2 h after the bleach nor was further fluorescence recovery seen 24 h later. However, 7–9 d after bleaching, some terminals demonstrated full recovery (Fig. 5 A, B), whereas other terminals showed only partial or no recov- ery of the IF. On average, presynaptic Syn-GFP signal had recov- ered to 67   25% of total Syn-GFP by 1 d after bleaching and was significantly higher (79   34% of total Syn-GFP) at 7–9 d after bleaching (n   20 synapses, 3 animals, paired t test p   0.02; Fig. 5C). Therefore,  36% of the IF from the first 10 min after the bleach eventually recovered after 7–9 d. This indicates that the IF component is heterogeneous, with more than one Syn-GFP ex- change rate.

\n## Pool of presynaptic  -synuclein is proteinase K resistant
\n
\nAlthough in vivo multiphoton FRAP is a useful tool for mea- suring the mobility of different Syn-GFP species at presynaptic terminals, the molecular nature of these different pools is un- clear. To better characterize Syn-GFP in cortical tissue, we treated fixed tissue sections and synaptosome-fractionated fresh brain tissue with proteinase K. Then, tissue sections were imaged with confocal microscopy and synaptosome fractions assayed by Western blotting to determine whether a proteinase K-resistant fraction was present. Proteinase K-resistance is a well established hallmark of certain aggregated species of  -synuclein (Takeda et al., 1998; Miake et al., 2002) and other neurodegeneration-associated proteins (Neumann et al., 2002). Although both somatic staining and the cytosolic frac- tion of Syn-GFP were almost completely abolished by proteinase K treatment (normalized somatic Syn-GFP signal in fixed tissue after proteinase K   0.042   0.041, n   3 animals; normalized cyto- solic fraction Syn-GFP signal in freshly prepared tissue after proteinase K   0.015   0.013, n   3 animals), a signif- icant fraction of presynaptic terminal Syn-GFP was not degraded by protei- nase K (normalized terminal Syn-GFP signal after proteinase K   0.44   0.21, n   3 animals, paired t test p   0.02; normalized synaptosome fraction Syn- GFP signal after proteinase K   0.35   0.13, n   3 animals, t test p   0.02), suggesting that aggregates were present only in presynaptic terminals (Fig. 6A– C). Mean Syn-GFP terminal intensity comparing slices from the same animal showed that proteinase K treatment re- sulted in a decrease in the frequency of “dim” terminals, with a relative sparing of the “bright” terminals (Fig. 6D), suggesting that terminals with high levels of Syn- GFP contain more of the aggregate form. We also measured the average terminal volume of Syn-GFP labeling under con- trol conditions and after proteinase K treatment. Interestingly, proteinase K treatment reduced terminal Syn-GFP vol- ume by  25% (average control volume   0.41   0.54  m 3, n   46,117 terminals, 3 animals; average proteinase K-treated volume   0.31   0.17  m3, n   24,009 terminals, 3 animals). Next, we measured the fraction of proteinase K-resistant Syn- GFP in terminals in different age groups. When comparing mice aged 1, 3–6, and 12–18 months, we detected no significant differences in the proteinase K-resistant fraction (data not shown) in these age groups, in agreement with our in vivo imaging data showing a similar IF across the ages tested.

\n## Pool of presynaptic  -synuclein is phosphorylated at serine- 129, oxidized, and associated with decreases in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin
\n
\nTo characterize the Syn-GFP aggregates in terminals, we stained fixed tissue for several molecular markers of specific aggregates. Serine-129 phosphorylation is a marker of  -synuclein aggregation and serine-129 phospho-antibodies stain Lewy pathology from hu- man tissue (Fujiwara et al., 2002) and aggregated  -synuclein in some mouse models (Emmer et al., 2011; Luk et al., 2012a,b). However, recent work has suggested that serine-129 phosphorylation is required for autophagy-mediated  -synuclein degradation and marks a pool that is not necessarily aggregated (Oueslati et al., 2013). In addition, in some mouse models (Tanji et al., 2010), there is evidence that presynaptic terminal proteinase K-resistant  -synuclein aggregates can exist without being phosphorylated at

\nPool of presynaptic  alpha-synuclein is phosphorylated at serine- 129, oxidized, and associated with decreases in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin
\nTo characterize the Syn-GFP aggregates in terminals, we stained fixed tissue for several molecular markers of specific aggregates. Serine-129 phosphorylation is a marker of  -synuclein aggregation and serine-129 phospho-antibodies stain Lewy pathology from hu- man tissue (Fujiwara et al., 2002) and aggregated  -synuclein in some mouse models (Emmer et al., 2011; Luk et al., 2012a,b). How- ever, recent work has suggested that serine-129 phosphorylation is required for autophagy-mediated  alpha-synuclein degradation and marks a pool that is not necessarily aggregated (Oueslati et al., 2013). In addition, in some mouse models (Tanji et al., 2010), there is evidence that presynaptic terminal proteinase K-resistant  alpha-synuclein aggregates can exist without being phosphorylated at serine-129. Oxidization of  -synuclein is another modification associated with human disease and this form is also present in Lewy pathology (Giasson et al., 2000). Therefore, we next mea- sured the serine-129 phosphorylation and oxidation status of terminal Syn-GFP aggregates in our system.
\n
\nIn our experiments, a subset of Syn-GFP-positive presyn- aptic terminals in the cortex colabeled with serine-129 phos- phorylated  -synuclein (Fig. 7A). However, the phosphorylated form was not detected in neuronal cell bodies (data not shown). Likewise, staining for oxidized  -synuclein colabeled with some Syn-GFP-positive presynaptic terminals (Fig. 7A), but not in cell bodies. There was also a significant positive correlation between the amount of serine-129-phosphorylated  -synuclein and the total Syn-GFP at each terminal, indicating that terminals with greater amounts of Syn-GFP contained more phosphorylated protein (r 2   0.34, p   0.0003, n   37 synapses; Fig. 7B). These results are consis- tent with the correlation between total Syn-GFP levels and the IF measured by in vivo imaging (Fig. 4C), indicating the presence of more aggregated protein in brightly labeled Syn-GFP terminals. To quantify the amount of colocalization between Syn-GFP and phospho-synuclein, we calculated the Pearson’s colocalization coefficient using Imaris software and found a significant amount of co- localization in Syn-GFP-positive presynaptic terminals (Pearson’s coefficient   0.194   0.042, n   3 animals, 4 cortical areas per animal; Fig. 7C). Next, we measured serine-129-phosphorylated  -synuclein levels in cortical terminals treated with proteinase K to determine whether the proteinase K-resistant fraction is phosphor- ylated. Using our protocol, phospho-synuclein staining was abol- ished by proteinase K treatment (data not shown). This suggests that these two aggregate pools are separate and that the proteinase K-resistant fraction is not phosphorylated at this residue, as is seen for presynaptic terminal aggregates in other human  alpha-synuclein overexpression transgenic models (Tanji et al., 2010). Furthermore, markers of amyloid-like aggregate species, thioflavine S (ThS), and mature Lewy pathology (anti-ubiquitin antibody staining) showed no clear colocalization with Syn-GFP-positive terminals (data not shown). Combined, these data suggest that the proteinase K-resistant, serine-129-phosphorylated, oxidized Syn-GFP presynaptic aggregate pools are not ubiquitinated or in an amyloid (ThS-binding) conformation.
\n
\nOur data presented above from in vivo imaging and protei- nase K digestion suggests that an aggregated pool of Syn-GFP in presynaptic terminals forms as early as 1 month after birth in this line and is present at relatively constant levels until the animals are  1 year-old. We next investigated whether these aggregates might be associated with evidence of terminal dys- function, as has been suggested to occur when  -synuclein is overexpressed (Scott et al., 2010; Larson et al., 2012; Scott and Roy, 2012). For example, Roy et al. demonstrated what they termed “vacant synapses” in a subset of terminals expressing Syn-GFP aggregates, which contained greatly reduced levels of several presynaptic vesicle proteins involved in exocytosis (Scott et al., 2010). We determined the levels of the vesicle protein synapsin in Syn-GFP-expressing versus Syn-GFP- nonexpressing cortical terminals (Fig. 7A) and found that Syn-GFP-expressing terminals had a large decrease in synap- sin staining in all age groups tested (1, 3– 6, or 12–18 months old; data not shown). The Pearson’s coefficient for colocaliza- tion between Syn-GFP-positive terminals and synapsin was close to zero, indicating that the proteins do not colocalize (Pearson’s   0.026   0.040, n   3, 1 year-old animals, 2 cortical areas per animal; Fig. 7C). In contrast, synapsin did colocalize with an antibody that recognizes mouse  -synuclein (Syn1), indicating that adjacent neurons that do not express the transgene likely have healthy synaptic function (Pearson’s   0.36   0.12, n   3, 1-year-old animals, 2 cortical areas per animal; Fig. 7C). These data suggest that presynaptic Syn-GFP aggregates are toxic to the normal exo- cytotic apparatus.

\n## Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates vesicle-bound and granular aggregate forms of terminal  -synuclein
\n
\nTo characterize the ultrastructural properties of Syn-GFP in cortical presynaptic terminals, we used EM pre-embedding DAB immunolabeling (Meshul and McGinty, 2000) with an anti-GFP antibody and a newly developed microwave fixa- tion/processing procedure (Walker et al., 2012). Syn-GFP- containing terminals showed two different patterns of DAB staining (Fig. 8A). The more common pattern was perivesicular labeling of Syn-GFP, which likely corresponds to the pre- sumed synaptic vesicle binding pool of Syn-GFP detected with in vivo FRAP. Association of  -synuclein with synap- tic vesicles has been described previ- ously (Maroteaux and Scheller, 1991; Shibayama-Imazu et al., 1993). We also ob- served a more granular pattern of Syn-GFP staining not associated with vesicles in a subset of terminals making both an inhibi- tory (symmetrical; Fig. 8A) and excitatory (asymmetrical; Fig. 8B) synaptic contacts. This appearance resembled the granular ag- gregates of  -synuclein seen in human (Sone et al., 2005) and mouse (Rockenstein et al., 2005; Rieker et al., 2011) tissue. This granular pattern may represent the aggregated, immobile Syn-GFP pool observed in our in vivo FRAP and ex vivo proteinase K experiments.

\n## Glutamate immunogold labeling demonstrates progressive dysfunction of  -synuclein-overexpressing terminals
\n
\nSeveral groups of investigators have sug- gested that  -synuclein overexpression can lead to synaptic dysfunction that can be measured at the ultrastructural level in dif- ferent systems (Scott et al., 2010, Scott and Roy, 2012; Larson et al., 2012). We per- formed quantitative immunogold analysis in the cortex of our transgenic mice to detect presynaptic glutamate in Syn-GFP-labeled versus Syn-GFP-unlabeled terminals at different ages. Glutamate immunogold la- beling can be used to detect this neurotrans- mitter in excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals, because glutamate is the direct precursor to GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian cortex (Meshul et al., 1994; Bamford et al., 2004). Our immunogold labeling in 3-month-old animals showed no significant differences in the density of particles in both asymmetric (unlabeled: 117   4.6 particles/ m2, Syn- GFP-labeled:96 19,ttestp 0.78,n 3 animals; Fig. 8C, error   SEM) and sym- metric (unlabeled: 97   3.5 particles/ m2,

In 9-month-old animals, however, a significant decrease in presynaptic glutamate immunogold labeling in Syn- GFP-positive asymmetric terminals (unlabeled: 74   4.2 particles/  m 2, Syn-GFP-labeled: 29   2.3, t test p   0.001, n   3 animals; Fig. 8B, error   SEM) was seen, which was also the case for terminals making a symmetrical synaptic contact (unlabeled: 89   16 parti- cles/ m 2, Syn-GFP-labeled: 20   2, t test p   0.01, n   3 animals). These data suggest that Syn-GFP overexpression, which we have shown is associated with presynaptic terminal microaggregate for mation at an early age, is also associated with an age-dependent decrease in glutamate im- munogold labeling in excitatory (asymmet- rical) and inhibitory (symmetrical) nerve terminals.

\n
\nIn previous work, we showed the feasibil- ity of using in vivo multiphoton FRAP to measure recovery of Syn-GFP in mouse cortex (Unni et al., 2010). In our current work, we expanded these methods to charac- terize Syn-GFP FRAP rigorously in vivo and demonstrate that it is an accurate way to mea- sure protein mobility free from confounding artifacts seen in other systems. We demon- strate that, under conditions of moderate  -synuclein overexpression, similar to mul- tiplication mutations that lead to human disease, in vivo aggregation is selectively found at presynaptic terminals starting at an early age (at least by 1 month of age), is not detectable in cell bodies, and is associated with significant decreases in the important presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin. In ad- dition, we measured the effective diffusion coefficient of Syn-GFP within different sub- cellular compartments, the relative fraction within free and bound terminal pools, the vesicle binding constants kon* and koff, and the exchange rate within terminal mi- croaggregates. All of these numbers have been impossible to measure in vivo in the brain until now. Our EM analysis demon- strates that Syn-GFP overexpression leads to progressive dysfunction, as measured by a decrease in presynaptic glutamate immunogold labeling in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
\n
\nOur results suggest that somatic Syn- GFP is soluble and freely diffusible, whereas in presynaptic terminals, at least three dif- ferent pools exist, one of which is soluble and freely diffusible. The other two lower mobility pools have very different recovery kinetics from each other, one on the order of 2.6 min and the other over several days or longer. Given substantial evidence that -synuclein normally binds presynaptic vesicles (Maroteaux and Scheller, 1991; Shibayama-Imazu et al., 1993; Davidson et al., 1998), including our own EM data showing perivesicular staining and data from cell-free systems demonstrating synaptosomal binding on the minutes time scale (Wislet-Gendebien et al., 2006, 2008), the pool with a  2.6 min recovery tau in our experiments likely represents soluble Syn-GFP binding to synaptic vesicles. The final presynaptic Syn-GFP species measured is more heterogeneous, with individual terminals showing no, partial, or complete recovery within 7–9 d. This pool likely rep- resents an  -synuclein microaggregate form. Its different recovery characteristics may be due to different maturation states, with more compact microaggregates exhibiting decreased Syn-GFP exchange. This kind of sequential compaction has been hypothesized to occur in human disease as part of a pathway toward Lewy pathology for- mation (Dale et al., 1992; Arima et al., 1998; Go ́ mez-Tortosa et al., 2000). It is important to note that our in vivo FRAP imaging is lim- ited for technical reasons to cells and synapses within superficial cortical layers (all data presented are from layers 2/3). Therefore, the potential somatic aggregation profile in deeper brain regions may not be the same as we measure here. It will be interesting in future studies to use alternative techniques, potentially including fiber- optic approaches (Flusberg et al., 2005; Murray and Levene, 2012), to probe the somatic aggregation profile of deeper structures. Pairing this with multicolor labeling approaches could help determine the IF in cortical terminals originating from different neuronal cell types throughout the brain.
\n
\nOur biochemical characterization also supports the presence of terminal Syn-GFP microaggregate species because proteinase K-resistant, serine-129-phosphorylated, and oxidized forms of Syn- GFP are present only in presynaptic terminals. These three specific  -synuclein modifications are common in PD and DLB human tis- sue (Takeda et al., 1998; Giasson et al., 2000; Fujiwara et al., 2002). We find that, depending on technique, 44   21% (confocal imaging in fixed tissue) or 35   13% (Western blotting of fresh tissue) of Syn-GFP in the synapse is proteinase K-resistant, which closely matches the 32   21% IF we detected with in vivo FRAP experiments, suggesting that this may be the same aggregate pool. Our measurements of the age dependence of ag- gregate formation suggest that a proteinase K-resistant, relatively immobile, Syn-GFP aggregate pool, which is not clearly phos- phorylated at serine-129, develops as early as 1 month of age. This fraction is associated with toxicity because there is coincident re- duction in the presynaptic vesicle protein synapsin. In addition, our quantitative im- munogold measurements show an age- dependent decrease in terminal glutamate labeling in Syn-GFP-containing synapses. We speculate, based on this evidence, that terminal microaggregates represent an early stage in the synucleinopathy pathologic cas- cade, forming first at presynaptic terminals because of the high local concentration of this protein here. These proteinase K-resistant aggregates could be causing im- mediate presynaptic abnormalities, as evidenced by the lack of synapsin in these synapses, but may also trigger a second slower process of degeneration requiring months to develop, which leads to decreased presynaptic neurotransmitter levels. Ulti- mately, this chronic synaptic dysfunction may lead to a “dying back” of affected ax- onal processes, as has been postulated to occur in several synucleinopathies (Adal- bert and Coleman, 2012; Yasuda et al., 2013). Alternatively, it is possible that the presynaptic microaggregates we measure may be beneficial because evidence sug- gests that certain  -synuclein aggregate species may be cytoprotective, potentially sequestering other more toxic species such as small oligomers (Nakamura et al., 2011) and therefore reducing neurode- generation (Tofaris and Spillantini, 2005; Bodner et al., 2006). Finally, it is also pos- sible that the presynaptic microaggregates are an epiphenomenon that is not linked directly to presynaptic dysfunction in an either helpful or harmful way. In this case, the microaggregates may be marking ter- minals where another toxic species is me- diating detrimental effects on synapsin and glutamate levels. Therefore, exploring these mechanisms further, including the distinct roles of posttranslationally modified and proteinase K-resistant

A, Electron photomicrograph showing unlabeled terminal (UnT) making an asymmetrical (double black arrows) synaptic contact onto a dendritic spine (DS), indicating that the synapse is excitatory. Also in the field is a DAB-labeled terminal (LT) making a symmetrical (inhibitory) synaptic contact (single black arrow) and containing a perivesicular (double white arrows) and granular (single white arrow) pattern of labeling. B, Top, Electron photomicrograph showing an unlabeled nerve terminal (UT) making an asymmetrical synaptic contact (arrow) onto a DS containing a spine apparatus (SA). Within the unlabeled nerve terminal are numerous 12 nm gold particles (arrowhead) indicating the location of an antibody against glutamate. There is also a DAB/  synuclein-GFP-labeled nerve terminal (LT) making an asymmetrical synaptic contact (arrow) onto a DS. Bottom, Group data from animals of two different age groups, 3 and 9 months old, showing a significant decrease in presynaptic glutamate levels in 9-month-old Syn-GFP-positive excitatory (asymmetrical) and inhibitory (symmetrical) nerve terminals. -synuclein terminal species in this system, will be an impor- tant avenue for future research. Interestingly, recent work sug- gests that serine-129 phosphorylation, specifically by Polo-like kinase 2, marks a pool which is in the process of being disaggre- gated and degraded by autophagy (Oueslati et al., 2013).
\n
\nSeveral groups of investigators have reported  -synuclein FRAP data in different systems (Fortin et al., 2005; van Ham et al., 2008). Most recently, Roberti et al. (2011) reported results from SHY-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell cultures using the biarsenical labeling compound ReAsH. Somatic aggregates and unaggregated protein were imaged by confocal microscopy. Within aggregates, one immobile and one mobile species were present. The IF within aggregates was  85% of total tagged synuclein, whereas the mobile fraction had a D eff of 0.035  m2/s. These results differ substantially from ours because we detected a single, freely diffusible Syn-GFP population within cortical neuron somata in vivo (Deff   8.6   3.8  m2/s) and 3 pools of Syn-GFP with differing levels of mobility ranging from milliseconds to days in synaptic terminals. It will be interesting to determine the nature of the  -synuclein species in these different systems and whether they share significant overlap or not.

It will be interesting to determine the nature of the  -synuclein species in these different systems and whether they share significant overlap or not.
\n
\nOur measurements of free Syn-GFP mobility, both in the soma and terminals, are experimentally indistinguishable from those we made for free GFP in these compartments, suggesting that free Syn-GFP may be monomeric. However, previous work has shown limitations of FRAP to resolve small differences in molecular weight. For example, it has been suggested that molec- ular weight changes of  10-fold are required before being clearly detected by FRAP (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001). If this is the case, the freely soluble pool of Syn-GFP we detect could exist as small ( 10-mer) multimers. We can confidently say, however, that they are not larger multimers ( 10-mers). Determining whether small multimers such as tetramers exist in vivo will be an interesting avenue for future studies because their presence is controversial (Bartels et al., 2011; Fauvet et al., 2012; Dettmer et al., 2013). Other fluorescence-based techniques adapted for in vivo use, such as fluorescent protein complementation, fluores- cence correlation spectroscopy, or fluorescence resonance energy transfer, may be useful to answer this question.
\n
\nExpression levels of Syn-GFP in this mouse line are two to three times that seen in normal human brain (Rockenstein et al., 2005), similar to patient tissue with multiplication mutations (Singleton et al., 2003). Therefore, these Syn-GFP mice may rep- resent a good model for the neuropathology that underlies early stages of synucleinopathy. Using a variety of techniques, includ- ing in vivo multiphoton imaging, proteinase K digestion, immu- nohistochemistry, and EM, we have demonstrated the presence of human  alpha-synuclein aggregates specifically in presynaptic ter- minals with a positive dose-aggregate relationship. In addition, we have not found evidence for somatic aggregates. This suggests that an early step underlying synucleinopathies is the develop- ment of specifically presynaptic aggregates. It will be interesting in future studies to pair this model with other factors implicated in disease pathogenesis, including mitochondrial toxins (Betar- bet et al., 2000; Uversky et al., 2001), point mutations (Polymero- poulos et al., 1997; Kru ̈ger et al., 1998; Zarranz et al., 2004), or inoculation with potentially prion-like  -synuclein aggregates (Luk et al., 2012a, 2012b; Masuda-Suzukake et al., 2013). This will allow testing of the hypothesis that presynaptic aggregate pathology, given specific triggers, can cause spreading of aggre- gation to the soma, as predicted by several groups of investigators (Galvin et al., 1999; Marui et al., 2002; Kramer and Schulz- Schaeffer, 2007). In addition, this model, with aggregation lim- ited to presynaptic terminals, may be useful for the study of therapies thought to only be beneficial early in the course of disease.

\n## Summary
\n
\nLoss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) are a major cause of early-onset familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recent studies have highlighted an important function for PINK1 in clearing depolarized mitochondria by mitophagy. However, the role of PINK1 in mitochondrial and cellular functioning in physiological conditions is still incompletely understood. Here, we investigate mitochondrial and cellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis in PINK1-knockdown and PINK1-knockout mouse cells, both in basal metabolic conditions and after physiological stimulation, using unbiased automated live single-cell imaging in combination with organelle-specific fluorescent probes. Our data reveal that depletion of PINK1 induces moderate fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased production of reactive oxygen species. This results in reduced uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria after physiological stimulation. As a consequence, cells with knockdown or knockout of PINK1 display impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis, which is exacerbated under conditions of increased ATP demand, thereby affecting cytosolic Ca2+ extrusion. The impairment in energy maintenance was confirmed in the brain of PINK1- knockout mice by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Our findings demonstrate a key role for PINK1 in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and energy metabolism under physiological conditions.
\n
\n## Introduction
\n
\nParkinson’s disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and is the most common age-related neurodegenerative movement disorder. The molecular mechanisms underlying the neuronal degeneration remain poorly understood, although a growing body of evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis (Abou- Sleiman et al., 2006). Exposure to mitochondrial toxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), resulted in PD-like symptoms in rodents and humans (Langston et al., 1983). Then, post-mortem studies reported deficiency of mitochondrial complex I in some sporadic PD patients (Schapira et al., 1989) and an increased number of somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations in nigral neurons (Bender et al., 2006). The strongest evidence, however, came from the discovery of gene mutations in mitochondrial proteins leading to inherited forms of PD (Gasser, 2009). Mutations in PINK1 were initially identified in three families with autosomal-recessive PD (Valente et al., 2004). Since then, many mutations have been found throughout PINK1, with the majority situated within the kinase domain. The location of these mutations and their recessive nature suggest that loss of PINK1 kinase function is responsible for disease onset (Matsuda et al., 2010).
\nPINK1 encodes a protein with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting motif, a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase domain and a C-terminal autoregulatory domain. PINK1 predominantly localizes to the mitochondria (Weihofen et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2008), suggesting a role in mitochondrial function. PINK1-deficient cells were shown to be more susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to mitochondrial toxic insults (Deng et al., 2005; Valente et al., 2004). In addition, inactivation of the Drosophila PINK1 ortholog induced a severe mitochondrial phenotype that consisted of mitochondrial aggregates, swollen and enlarged mitochondria and reduced ATP synthesis, both in flight muscle cells and dopaminergic neurons (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). Furthermore, knockdown of PINK1 in mammalian cells, as well as PINK1 mutations in fibroblasts from patients with PD, have been associated with (sometimes contradictory) changes in mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial membrane potential (Exner et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2009; Sandebring et al., 2009; Weihofen et al., 2009; Wood-Kaczmar et al., 2008).
\n
\nIn the present study, we investigated mitochondrial metabolism and cellular Ca2+ homeostasis using unbiased automated live single- cell imaging. We studied dynamic processes such as mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, ATP synthesis and cytosolic Ca2+ metabolism in resting and stimulated conditions. We demonstrate that silencing of Pink1 induces moderate mitochondrial fragmentation and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, which results in impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ influx. As a consequence, energy maintenance becomes problematic, especially under conditions of increased energy demand. These findings suggest a physiological role for PINK1 in mitochondrial homeostasis.

\n## Results
\n
\n### Depletion of PINK1 by RNAi-mediated knockdown in mouse cells and by the generation of PINK1-knockout mice
\n
\nWe investigated the function of PINK1 by mimicking the loss of function that results from the clinical PINK1 mutations using two complementary strategies. First, we induced stable knockdown (KD) of PINK1 in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using two lentiviral vectors (LVs) expressing a miRNA30-based short-hairpin sequence (sh1PINK1 or sh2PINK1) against mouse Pink1. LV-sh1PINK1 and LV-sh2PINK1 decreased levels of Pink1 mRNA in selected cells by ~70% and ~85%, respectively (supplementary material Fig. S1A,B).
\n
\nSecond, we generated PINK1-knockout (KO) mice by targeted deletion of exon 1 (supplementary material Fig. S1C,D). Loss of Pink1 mRNA expression in brain and primary MEFs was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (supplementary material Fig. S1E). Cell growth was not detectably altered in PINK1-KO MEFs (supplementary material Fig. S1F), confirming that any phenotypical differences observed are not due to differences in growth rate. Also, there was no evidence of apoptosis upon exposure to the different fluorescent probes and substrates used in further experiments (data not shown).
\n
\n### Loss of PINK1 induces moderate mitochondrial fragmentation in mammalian cells
\nSilencing of the Drosophila PINK1 ortholog is associated with mitochondrial enlargement and disintegration (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). However, in PINK1-depleted mammalian cells, mitochondrial morphology changes are either absent or relatively small, and point to fission rather than fusion (Dagda et al., 2009; Exner et al., 2007; Morais et al., 2009; Sandebring et al., 2009). To assess the effect of silencing of Pink1 on mitochondrial morphology in an unambiguous way, we used live imaging of cells loaded with the mitochondrial fluorescent dye TMRM (Fig. 1A). Unbiased quantification in a large population of cells revealed a 25% decrease in mitochondrial form factor (F), a combined measure of mitochondrial length and degree of branching, in PINK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 1B). This effect was paralleled by a 22% decrease in mitochondrial area (AM) and a 20% increase in the number of mitochondrial objects per cell (Nc) (Fig. 1C,D), whereas total mitochondrial mass (MM) was identical in PINK1-KO and control MEFs (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained after RNAi-based silencing of Pink1 in undifferentiated N2a cells and in primary MEFs (Fig. 1B–E). However, because TMRM uptake by the mitochondria is dependent on the membrane potential (), we also determined the mitochondrial mass in a -independent manner by high-content quantification of total TOM-20  immunofluorescence per cell. This analysis showed an 11% increase in mitochondrial mass in PINK1-KO cells (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data indicate that depletion of PINK1 causes moderate fragmentation of functional mitochondria in mammalian cells, and a slight accumulation of depolarized mitochondria.
\n
\nPINK1-deficient cells display increased levels of reactive oxygen species
\nMitochondria are an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered levels of ROS indicate changes in mitochondrial physiology (Forkink et al., 2010). To assess ROS levels, we used live cell imaging of MEFs pre-incubated with hydroethidine (HEt) (Koopman et al., 2005). Intracellularly, HEt reacts with ROS to form fluorescent, positively charged 2-hydroxyethidium and ethidium products. Subcellular quantification of these HEt oxidation products in mitochondria-rich regions revealed an increase of about 15% in both PINK1-KD and PINK-KO MEFs (Fig. 1G). Replacing glucose by galactose in the culture medium to stimulate mitochondrial energy metabolism, further increased HEt oxidation in

\n
\n### Silencing of PINK1 affects the mitochondrial membrane potential
\nMaintenance of a sufficiently large, inside-negative  across the mitochondrial inner membrane is crucial for mitochondrial function and integrity. To assess , we quantified the average mitochondrial fluorescence intensity of the cationic TMRM (Koopman et al., 2008; Nicholls and Ward, 2000). When mitochondrial accumulation of TMRM exceeds a certain concentration, autoquenching is induced, resulting in a transient increase in TMRM signal (due to dequenching) upon  depolarization. Control experiments revealed that addition of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) induced an immediate decrease without a transient increase in TMRM fluorescence (supplementary material Fig. S2). Therefore, TMRM fluorescence is not autoquenched in our experiments. Subsequent single-cell measurements revealed a significant reduction in mitochondrial TMRM pixel intensity in PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A), supporting the conclusion that mitochondria in PINK1-deficient cells have a depolarized .
\n
\n### PINK1-deficient cells have normal respiratory complexes
\n
\nThe mitochondrial membrane potential is maintained by complex I to complex IV of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. These complexes use the energy obtained from the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 to extrude protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. The electrochemical proton gradient generated this way drives the ATP production at complex V. To determine whether  depolarization in PINK1-deficient cells was related to malfunctioning of the OXPHOS system, we determined the maximal activity of individual OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria-enriched fractions.
\n
\nAdditionally, we analyzed the activity of citrate synthase (CS), a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. All enzymes displayed normal activity in PINK1- KD and PINK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with PINK1-deficient N2a cells (supplementary material Fig. S3A). The absence of large changes in CS activity is compatible with our finding that PINK1 deficiency only slightly affects mitochondrial mass. Native gel electrophoresis of mitochondrial fractions followed by either western blotting or IGA measurement again revealed similar amounts and activities of complex I in PINK1-KD, PINK1- KO and control MEFs (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis further showed that the other OXPHOS complexes were also normally expressed in PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO MEFs (supplementary material Fig. S3B). In addition, we quantified NAD(P)H autofluorescence in mitochondria-enriched regions of individual MEFs as a functional readout for cellular metabolic activity. Similar levels of NAD(P)H autofluorescence were observed in PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO MEFs as in control cells (Fig. 2D). Acute treatment with the specific complex I inhibitor rotenone increased the autofluorescence signal in PINK1-deficient MEFs to the same level as in controls. Together, these data indicate that PINK1 deficiency does not alter OXPHOS expression and/or activity.
\n
\n### Depletion of PINK1 results in impairment of stimulated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
\n
\nMany extracellular stimuli exert their effect through an increase in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]C) mediated by the stimulated influx of extracellular Ca2+ and/or the stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, predominantly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depending on their membrane potential and energization state, mitochondria take up a greater or lesser part of the Ca2+ that enters the cytosol.
\n
\nTo measure mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]M), cells were stably transduced with a LV encoding mitochondrial aequorin (mtAEQ) which emits visible light in a Ca2+-concentration-dependent manner (Rizzuto et al., 1992). Stimulation of N2a cells and primary MEFs caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]M as a result of Ca2+ influx via the electrogenic Ca2+ uniporter. The peak value was significantly decreased by about 20% in PINK1-KD N2a cells compared with different control cell lines (from 91.35±2.74 M in non-transduced cells, 86.95±3.08 M in LV-blasti cells and 86.91±1.54 M in sh1PINK1MM cells to 70.28±1.19 M and 65.8±2.49 M in sh1PINK1 and sh2PINK1 cells, respectively) (Fig. 3A,B). A similar reduction in peak [Ca2+]M increase was observed in PINK1-KD primary MEFs (Fig. 3C,D). Complete absence of PINK1 did not further reduce the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in PINK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 3E,F). Similar values were obtained in galactose culture conditions (Fig. 3F). In all conditions tested, basal mitochondrial Ca2+ levels did not significantly differ between control cells and PINK1-KD or PINK1-KO cells. Pretreatment of the cells with FCCP abolished the [Ca2+]M increase induced by BK or ATP (data not shown), confirming that mtAEQ localizes to the mitochondrial matrix (Visch et al., 2004).
\n
\nBecause the [Ca2+]M data acquired involved monitoring of the luminescence in total cell populations, we next investigated the cells in more detail by means of single-cell digital microscopy. Moreover, the mtAEQ measurements described above do not allow reliable analysis of the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca2+ release because the decline of the mtAEQ signal might not only reflect the decrease in [Ca2+]M, but also the depletion of the mtAEQ – coelenterazine complex (Visch et al., 2006). Therefore, MEFs were loaded with the mitochondria-specific fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Rhod-2. Digital imaging microscopy of individual MEFs showed a 25% reduction of the peak increase in Rhod-2 fluorescence following ATP stimulation in PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 3G,H). This confirms the reduced [Ca2+]M peak value observed with the mtAEQ measurements. To analyze the subsequent mitochondrial Ca2+ release, mono-exponential fitting of the subsequent decrease in Rhod-2 fluorescence was performed. These calculations revealed no differences between PINK1-KD or PINK1- KO MEFs and controls (blasti, t1/235.13±8.14 seconds; PINK1- KD, t1/234.68±4.58 seconds; PINK1 wild type, t1/228.12±4.79 seconds; PINK1-KO, t1/232.82±2.97 seconds), which suggests normal functioning of the mitochondrial Ca2+-extrusion mechanisms in PINK1-deficient cells.
\nPINK1-deficient cells show decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis
\nAgonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]M boosts the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, two key regulatory dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase) and complex V. This in turn stimulates the OXPHOS complexes, resulting in increased mitochondrial ATP ([ATP]M) synthesis (Jouaville et al., 1999; Valsecchi et al., 2009). To investigate whether the impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake observed in the PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO cells affected [ATP]M, we determined these levels in resting and stimulated cells. To measure the resting ATP levels, primary MEFs stably expressing mtLUC were perfused with D-luciferin (100 M) and luminescence was quantified by means of photon counting. Approximately 2 minutes after the onset of D-luciferin perfusion (defined as time point t1), comparable bioluminescence maxima were reached in PINK1-KD and control MEFs (Fig. 4A,B). However, continued monitoring of the basal [ATP]M showed a subsequent decrease to a new steady-state level (defined as time point t2) by 22.30±2.86% in PINK1-KD MEFs and by only 3.17±0.89% in control MEFs (Fig. 4C). Comparable data were obtained in galactose medium (supplementary material Fig. S4A–C). A similar decrease of 19.77±0.66% was observed in PINK1-KO MEFs, whereas control MEFs showed a decrease of only 4.40±0.37% (Fig. 4E,G). Increasing the amount of D-luciferin to 500 M revealed differences between control MEFs (22.43±1.07%) and PINK1-KO MEFs (17.08±1.47%) at time point t1 (Fig. 4I,J), whereas at t2 the bioluminescence values in these cells were decreased by 11.07±0.56% and 36.89±2.16%, respectively (Fig. 4K). Together, these findings indicate that unstimulated PINK1-deficient cells are unable to maintain basal [ATP]M levels under conditions of increased ATP demand.
\nNext, to determine the effect of PINK1 deficiency on agonist- induced increase in mitochondrial ATP concentration, MEFs were challenged with the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist ATP to induce a maximal increase in [Ca2+]C and [Ca2+]M. Under these stimulatory conditions, PINK1-KD MEFs showed a markedly reduced [ATP]M peak (defined as time point t3) in both glucose (Fig. 4A,D) and galactose medium (supplementary material Fig. S4A,D). The agonist-induced peak increase in bioluminescence was also significantly reduced in PINK1- KO MEFs (t3 values of 100±1.20% and 40.08±1.71% in control and PINK1-KO MEFs, respectively) (Fig. 4E,H).
\n
\nTo investigate the specificity of the observed mitochondrial phenotype, we determined [ATP]M following reintroduction of human WT PINK1, a PD-linked W437X PINK1 mutant or an artificial triple kinase-dead (3xKD) PINK1 mutant. Expression of human WT PINK1 and its mutants resulted in comparable PINK1 protein overexpression levels (supplementary material Fig. S5A) in nearly all cells (supplementary material Fig. S5B). Nevertheless, PINK1-KO MEFs back-complemented with human WT PINK1 showed a partial rescue of the signal at t2 (i.e. the decrease was normalized from 19.77±0.66% to 9.58±0.45%) and at t3 (the peak value was enhanced from 40.08±1.71% to 76.77±2.41%), whereas both PINK1 mutants completely failed to restore mitochondrial ATP synthesis (Fig. 4E–H). In control MEFs, stable overexpression of WT PINK1 or the mutants did not affect any of the parameters tested (supplementary material Fig. S4E–H).
\n
\n### PINK1-deficient cells display altered cytosolic Ca2+ metabolism under conditions of high ATP demand
\n
\nCytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis are tightly coupled. Indeed, mitochondria control the amplitude, spatial spreading and duration of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal by taking up Ca2+ and releasing ATP to directly or indirectly fuel cytosolic Ca2+-extrusion mechanisms via Ca2+-ATPases of the plasma membrane (PMCA), Ca2+-ATPases of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) or Na+–Ca2+ exchangers of the plasma membrane. Using live cell imaging of cells loaded with the cytosolic Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, we next investigated whether PINK1 deficiency affected cytosolic Ca2+ signals.
\n
\nNo difference in resting [Ca2+]C was observed between unstimulated PINK1-KO and control MEFs (Fig. 5A and supplementary material Table S2). Likewise, when cells were stimulated with ATP, no difference in peak [Ca2+]C increase was observed. These results were reproduced in PINK1-KD MEFs (supplementary material Table S2) and N2a cells (Fig. 5B and supplementary material Table S3) and demonstrate that the observed reductions in agonist-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in PINK1- KD and PINK1-KO cells cannot be explained by a reduced increase in overall [Ca2+]C. After reaching a peak value, [Ca2+]C levels gradually declined again to pre-stimulatory levels. The rate of [Ca2+]C decline was unaltered in PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO MEFs (Fig. 5A and supplementary material Table S2). This result was somewhat unexpected because of the marked reduction in the agonist-induced [ATP]M peak that we observed (see Fig. 4). To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we artificially lowered the [Ca2+]M peak, to establish a dose-response relationship between [Ca2+]M and the kinetics of cytosolic Ca2+ removal. Therefore, cells were stimulated in the presence of increasing concentrations of Rhod-2 because this cation has been demonstrated to decrease the amplitude of agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]M and as a consequence to reduce the mitochondrial ATP synthesis and cytosolic Ca2+ removal rate (Visch et al., 2006).
\nAfter pretreatment of control cells with increasing concentrations of Rhod-2, [Ca2+]M and [Ca2+]C were monitored in ATP-stimulated MEFs. Rhod-2 dose-dependently lowered the agonist-induced [Ca2+]M peak in control MEFs (Fig. 5C,D). At 10 M, the effect of Rhod-2 (~20% decrease) was comparable to results obtained with silencing of Pink1 (compare with Fig. 3A to F). Similarly to depletion of PINK1, this concentration of Rhod-2 did not alter resting [Ca2+]C, the agonist-induced [Ca2+]C peak or the rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal (Fig. 5E and supplementary material Table S2). At 30 M, however, Rhod-2 increased the resting [Ca2+]C, decreased the agonist-induced peak [Ca2+]M by 80% and decreased the rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal compared with control cells (Fig. 5C–E and supplementary material Table S2). Similar effects of Rhod-2 were obtained in N2a cells (supplementary material Table S3).
\n
\nNext, because the reduction in the agonist-induced [ATP]M peak
\nbecame apparent in stimulated cells in the presence of D-luciferin
\n(see Fig. 4), we reasoned that similar conditions might be required
\nto unmask potential problems with cytosolic Ca2+ handling. To test
\nthis possibility, we measured the rate of [Ca2+]C decline in MEFs
\nexpressing mtLUC following stimulation in the presence of 100
\nM D-luciferin to increase ATP consumption. Because the
\nexcitation spectra of Fura-2 and luciferin partially overlap, MEFs
\nwere loaded with the cytosolic Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4. Five minutes
\nafter onset of luciferin perfusion, [Ca2+]C levels in resting PINK1-
\nKO MEFs were significantly increased compared with the level in
\ncontrol cells, suggesting a decreased rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal.
\nWhen these MEFs were subsequently challenged with ATP, a
\nsimilar peak [Ca2+]C increase was observed in control and PINK1
\nKO MEFs which indicates that the size of the ER Ca2+ store is not
\naltered after incubation for 5 minutes in the presence of D-luciferin.
\nMono-exponential fitting of the subsequent decrease of the Fluo-4
\nsignal showed a significantly reduced rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal
\nin PINK1-KO MEFs, shown by an increased t value in PINK1- 1/2
\nKO MEFs (Fig. 5F and supplementary material Table S2).
\n
\nWe conclude that the decrease in mitochondrial ATP synthesis in PINK1-deficient cells is insufficient to alter cytosolic ATP- dependent processes such as Ca2+ extrusion after agonist stimulation. However, under conditions of increased ATP demand, PINK1-deficient cells are unable to produce sufficient amounts of ATP as reflected by decreased [ATP]M and decreased rates of cytosolic Ca2+ removal at rest and after stimulation.
\n
\n### Mitochondrial ATP levels are reduced in the brain of PINK1-deficient mice
\n
\nBecause mitochondrial ATP synthesis is severely impaired in PINK1-KO MEFs, we next asked whether this also holds true for the brains of these mice. We have previously shown that LVs encoding firefly luciferase enable long-term quantitative imaging of reporter gene expression in mouse brain using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (Deroose et al., 2006). Because luciferase can only generate photons via oxidation of its substrate D-luciferin in the presence of ATP, we used the BLI signal as read-out to noninvasively monitor the mitochondrial ATP levels in the brain of living mice. Therefore, we injected LVs encoding mtLUC in the striatum of both Pink1+/+ and Pink1–/– mice. Mice were monitored by BLI at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after injection. Images of all time points demonstrated a stable BLI signal originating from the striatum of both groups, but the bioluminescence signal was significantly lower (about 35%) in Pink1–/– mice (Fig. 6). In conclusion, the reduced ATP levels in vivo are compatible with the mitochondrial ATP synthesis deficit observed in primary PINK1- KO MEFs.
\n
\n## Discussion
\nMitochondria are essential for cell survival because they are involved in energy metabolism, cell signaling and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Several lines of evidence suggest a pivotal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of different human diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (Abou- Sleiman et al., 2006). In this study, we investigated the physiological role of PINK1 in the function and structural integrity of mitochondria via specific depletion of PINK1 in cell culture and in the brain of mice. Both RNAi-mediated knockdown and genetic knockout of PINK1 induced a very similar mitochondrial phenotype, suggesting that, at least for the aspects of mitochondrial function we studied, no (additional) compensatory mechanisms occur in the primary PINK1-KO MEFs compared with PINK1-KD cells. Our findings support the conclusion that PINK1 has a key role in the regulation of mitochondrial function under basal and stimulated conditions.
\nMitochondria are dynamic organelles whose morphology changes according to the energy requirements and health of the cell (Wasilewski and Scorrano, 2009). For this reason, a proper balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion is crucial to maintain normal mitochondrial function and thus cell homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of PINK1 is paralleled with moderate mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, in agreement with other studies in PINK1-KD mammalian cells and in primary fibroblasts from patients with PD (Exner et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2009; Sandebring et al., 2009; Weihofen et al., 2009; Wood- Kaczmar et al., 2008). This contrasts with findings in Drosophila where PINK1 promotes mitochondrial fission (Deng et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008) and to a recent study in immortalized PINK1- KO MEFs, in which no changes in mitochondrial morphology were observed (Morais et al., 2009). These differences might reflect cell type-dependent metabolic differences between insect, primary and immortalized cells, which are known to affect mitochondrial morphology (Rossignol et al., 2004). Our study revealed that depletion of PINK1 not only induces mitochondrial fragmentation, but is also associated with a depolarized . These data are compatible with the recently proposed model that mitochondrial fission segregates damaged mitochondria, which decreases their mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by selective targeting of these depolarized mitochondria by autophagy (Twig et al., 2008). However, because mitophagy is compromised in PINK1-deficient cells, these damaged mitochondria are cleared less efficiently, which was reflected by a slightly increased mitochondrial mass after silencing of Pink1. This also implies that mitochondrial fragmentation is rather secondary to the primary defect in mitophagic turnover.
\n is a key regulator of mitochondrial health and reflects the efficiency of proton extrusions across the inner mitochondrial membrane through the action of the OXPHOS complexes. In agreement with other studies (Gandhi et al., 2009; Piccoli et al., 2008; Wood-Kaczmar et al., 2008), we did not observe differences in maximal activity for the OXPHOS complexes in PINK1-KD or PINK1-KO cells. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the OXPHOS system might operate less efficiently in resting PINK1-deficient cells, thus explaining the depolarized . Although NAD(P)H levels were not significantly altered in these cells, a possible explanation could be a reduced supply of NADH by the TCA cycle. This suggests that the depolarized  might be due to a reduced substrate delivery, as recently observed in PINK1- KD and PINK1-KO neurons (Gandhi et al., 2009). Other studies have reported that depletion of PINK1 reduces the activity of different OXPHOS complexes (Gautier et al., 2008; Gegg et al., 2009; Grunewald et al., 2009; Morais et al., 2009). However, the lack of selectivity for one of the complexes suggests that the reduced activity of the complexes might rather be an epiphenomenon of PINK1 silencing, possibly caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA as a result of sustained oxidative stress.
\n
\nAt the functional level, our study demonstrates that depletion of PINK1 significantly reduces agonist-stimulated Ca2+ entry into the mitochondrial matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on direct [Ca2+]M measurements in PINK1-KD or PINK1- KO cells. Mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics is guided by the balance between Ca2+ influx through the highly selective Ca2+ uniporter (Kirichok et al., 2004) and Ca2+ extrusion through the Na+- and H+-dependent Ca2+ exchanger. Because the decay rate of Rhod-2 fluorescence to pre-stimulatory levels was similar in PINK1-KD, PINK1-KO and control cells, our findings suggest that silencing of PINK1 does not influence mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux, thereby indicating a normal functioning of this Ca2+ extrusion pathway. However, Ca2+ uptake in the mitochondrial matrix depends on the electrical driving force that is established by  (Rutter and Rizzuto, 2000). Therefore, the lower agonist-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ peak level in the PINK1-deficient MEFs probably reflects the partial loss of .
\n
\nLive bioluminescence imaging of [ATP]M in unstimulated PINK1-depleted MEFs demonstrated a decreased ATP synthesis capacity under conditions of prolonged and/or increased ATP demand. This reduced ability to maintain basal [ATP]M levels in the presence of luciferase might be a consequence of increased ATP hydrolysis by complex V in the PINK1-KD or PINK1-KO conditions in an attempt to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential (Gandhi et al., 2009; Morais et al., 2009).
\n
\nIt is well known that [Ca2+]M allosterically triggers the enzymatic activity of the TCA cycle and complex V, resulting in increased NADH and FADH2 levels, and subsequently, in an augmentation of the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (Rutter and Rizzuto, 2000; Valsecchi et al., 2009). Because depletion of PINK1 induced a  depolarization with a concomitant reduction of the agonist- stimulated increase in [Ca2+]M, we further demonstrated that silencing of Pink1 also seriously decreased agonist-induced ATP production. These data are in agreement with previous studies, showing that the agonist-induced peak increase in [ATP]M was reduced to half when the agonist-induced peak increase in [Ca2+]M was reduced by no more than 30% (Jouaville et al., 1999). The observed deficit in ATP synthesis could be rescued by reintroduction of human WT PINK1, but not the PINK1 mutants (3xKD and W437X) in the PINK1-deficient cells. These data are in agreement with a recent study where PINK1 kinase activity (which is reduced or absent in the tested PINK1 mutants) proved essential for parkin binding and subsequent mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (Geisler et al., 2010b). In addition, the reduced binding to the pro-apoptotic protein Beclin-1 reported for the W437X mutant might also interfere with proper activation of mitophagy (Michiorri et al., 2010).
\n
\nOwing to the aberrations in ATP homeostasis, the fuelling of many ATP-requiring processes such as vesicle and organelle transport (Rintoul et al., 2006), macromolecule synthesis and degradation (Rabl et al., 2008) and maintenance of ATPase- mediated ion gradients (Pizzo and Pozzan, 2007) might become compromised. Somewhat surprisingly, the depletion of [ATP]M observed in the PINK1-deficient cells was insufficient to induce a reduction in cytosolic Ca2+ extrusion by SERCA and/or PMCA pumps, because the rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal in stimulated cells was similar to that in control cells. However, when ATP consumption was stimulated by D-luciferin, [Ca2+]C extrusion was slower in stimulated mtLUC-expressing PINK1-KO MEFs. This suggests that, under conditions of increased ATP demand, PINK1- KD and PINK1-KO MEFs cannot generate sufficient ATP for proper fuelling of ATP-demanding processes such as [Ca2+]C extrusion. In dopaminergic neurons, reduced availability of ATP 2+ might lead even faster to a sustained increase in [Ca ]C levels, because these cells display autonomous pacemaking activity, resulting in a high ATP demand (Chan et al., 2010).
\n
\nTo corroborate the physiological relevance of our cell culture
\ndata, we performed in vivo bioluminescence imaging in the brain
\nof adult Pink1–/– mice, which revealed a similar reduction in basal
\n[ATP] levels compared with that in age-matched Pink1+/+ mice. M
\n
\nPINK1 and parkin act in a common pathway, with parkin being downstream of
\nPINK1 (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). These proteins appear to have an important role in mitochondrial quality control and specific disposal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagic clearance. During mitophagy, PINK1 selectively accumulates on depolarized mitochondria and thereby acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of parkin, leading to specific turnover of the dysfunctional mitochondria (Geisler et al., 2010a; Matsuda et al., 2010; Michiorri et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010; Vives- Bauza et al., 2010). Given the fact that depletion of PINK1 adversely affects this pathway, it is likely that defective mitochondria will accumulate inside PINK1-KD and PINK1-KO cells. Indeed, our data demonstrate that silencing of Pink1 results in an increased number of fragmented and depolarized mitochondria. In addition, oxidative stress (ROS) is increased, which will further extend mitochondrial damage. As a consequence, mitochondrial Ca2+ influx becomes impaired, leading to reduced [ATP]M production and aberrant cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Of note, most of the data presented in this study were obtained in neuronal cell lines (N2A) and in primary fibroblasts, which showed very similar phenotypes. In the future, it will be interesting to explore different aspects of our findings in mouse brain or in primary neuronal cultures, but these measurements are technically challenging and will require further optimization.
\n
\nIn summary, our study provides evidence that PINK1 has an important role in maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis in cells under physiological conditions. These data provide a better insight as to how loss of PINK1 function might lead to neurodegeneration in PD.

\n## Materials and Methods
\n
\n### Generation of PINK1-knockout mice
\n
\nThe Pink1 locus was targeted by homologous recombination in mouse E14.1 embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129/Ola mice. The targeting vector containing a 5  homologous arm consisting of a 6.0 kb upstream genomic region of exon1 followed by the neomycin resistance gene, and a 2.2 kb 3  homologous arm consisting of a part of intron1 at the 3 end was electroporated into ES cells. Neomycin-positive clones were selected and genotypically analyzed with the following primers: 5 - TCACACATCCAACCACGTTC-3  (P1), 5 -CAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATC-3  (P2), 5 -GTTCCATTGGCAACACCAC-3  (P3) and 5 -TGCAATCCATCTTGTTCAA- TGG-3  (P4). Microinjection of positive ES cells into the blastocysts of C57Bl/6J mice resulted in chimeric offspring. Mice containing the wild-type (Pink1+/+) or the mutant (Pink1+/–) Pink1 allele were further bred to a C57Bl/6Jtyrc-2J genetic background for at least four generations and finally intercrossed to obtain homozygous mutant mice (Pink1–/–) with a homogenous background. All animal experiments were approved by the bioethics committee of K.U.Leuven.
\n
\n### Fibroblast cell culture
\nPink1+/+ and Pink1–/– mice were interbred. E13.5 embryos were dissected and heads and red organs were removed. The embryo bodies were repeatedly pushed through an 18 G needle in the presence of trypsin (Sigma). After incubation (5 minutes at 37°C), further disaggregation was performed using a 24 G needle. The single-cell suspension was seeded in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with Glutamax (GIBCO BRL, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma), gentamicin (50 g/ml; GIBCO BRL, Invitrogen) and 1% nonessential amino acids (GIBCO) and cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The primary MEFs could be cultured up to eight passages. In some experiments, MEFs were cultured in galactose-containing medium (DMEM deprived of glucose) supplemented with 10 mM galactose, 4 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10% dialyzed FCS and gentamycin) for six consecutive days. Mouse N2a cells were cultured in similar conditions to MEFs, but without addition of nonessential amino acids to the medium. These N2a cells were not differentiated before experiments were performed.
\n
\n### Cloning of transfer plasmids
\n
\nPINK1 knockdown was achieved with lentiviral vector (LV)-based vectors encoding modified miRNA30-based short-hairpin (sh) sequences against two different regions in mouse PINK1 (supplementary material Table S1) and a blasticidin-resistance cassette (Sun et al., 2006). Functionality of the sh2PINK1 sequence has been previously validated (Zhou et al., 2007). As a negative control, a four nucleotide mismatch (MM) miRNA30-based short-hairpin sequence was designed. Mitochondrial targeted aequorin (mtAEQ), luciferase (mtLUC) (provided by Rosario Rizzuto, University of Ferrara, Italy) and eGFP (mtGFP) were PCR amplified and cloned in a LV transfer plasmid upstream of an IRES-hygromycin B resistance gene. cDNA of human WT PINK1 and two recessive mutants (W437X and triple kinase- dead, 3xKD) (gift from Philipp J. Kahle, University of Tübingen, Germany) was cloned in a LV transfer plasmid upstream of an IRES-puromycin cassette.
\n
\n### LV production and transduction
\n
\nLV production was performed as described previously (Ibrahimi et al., 2009). Cells were transduced with LV diluted in the cell culture medium. After 72 hours, vector- containing medium was replaced by medium with blasticidin (12 g/ml, Invitrogen), hygromycin B (200 g/ml, Invitrogen) or puromycin (3 g/ml, Invitrogen) to select for transduced cells.
\n
\n### Quantitative PCR
\n
\nTo determine Pink1 mRNA levels in transduced cells, 5 g total RNA was reverse- transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems) and cDNA was used in quadruplicate as template for quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) amplification with Taqman® probe based detection, as described previously (Taymans et al., 2006). The Pink1 mRNA levels were normalized to levels of Gapdh mRNA.
\n
\n### Luminescence monitoring of mitochondrial Ca2+ and mitochondrial ATP
\n
\nChanges in the free mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M) and [ATP] ([ATP]M) in N2a and MEF cells were determined by luminometry (Visch et al., 2006). Briefly, to monitor luminescence of mtLUC, coverslips were placed in the 37°C thermostated luminometer and perfused (3 ml/minute) with HEPES–Tris (HT) buffer containing 100 M D-luciferin (Xenogen). At the end of each experiment, cells were lysed with 100 M digitonin in the presence of 10 mM Mg-ATP to determine the maximal mtLUC signal which was set at 100% (Valsecchi et al., 2009). Light output was integrated during 1 second and recorded at intervals of 2 seconds. The same custom built set-up was used to monitor mtAEQ photon emission. Before [Ca2+]M measurements, mtAEQ was reconstituted with 5 M native coelenterazine (Invitrogen) in DMEM medium for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were perfused with KREBS medium, followed by lysis in Ca2+-rich medium (100 M digitonin and 10 mM CaCl2 in H2O) to calibrate the luminescence data. mtAEQ photon emission was converted off-line into [Ca2+]M values, using a computer algorithm (Brini et al., 1995).
\n
\n### Fluorescence imaging of the cytosolic free-Ca2+ levels
\nCells were loaded with 3 M Fura-2 (Invitrogen) (25 minutes, 37°C) to quantify changes in free cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]C) (Visch et al., 2006). After thorough washing with HT buffer, coverslips were mounted in a temperature-controlled (37°C) superfusion chamber attached to the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200 M; Zeiss) equipped with a 40  NA1.25 Plan NeoFluar objective. Fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm alternately using a monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics). Fluorescence emission light was directed by a 415DCLP dichroic mirror (Omega Optical) through a 510WB40 emission filter on a CoolSNAP HQ monochrome CCD camera (Roper Scientific). A camera exposure time of 200 mseconds and interframe interval of 1 second were used. To quantify [Ca2+]C signals in the presence of D-luciferin, cells were loaded with 2.5 M Fluo-4 and imaged using a 505DRLPXR dichroic mirror and a 515ALP emission filter (camera exposure time: 200 mseconds; interframe interval: 1 second). At the end of each measurement, cells were scraped off the coverslip to allow correction for background fluorescence. Changes in [Ca2+]C were evoked in N2a cells and MEFs by superfusion with bradykinin (BK; 1 M) or ATP (1 mM), respectively. The kinetics of Ca2+ removal after cell stimulation were fitted to a mono-exponential equation: y(t)y0+ymax·e–t, where  is the decay time constant, ymax represents the maximal Fura-2 ratio signal after stimulation and y0 is the basal ratio to which y(t) declines. The halftime (t1/2) was given by: t1/2 (s)–ln(0.5)·.
\n
\n### Fluorescence imaging of the mitochondrial free-Ca2+ levels
\nTo measure [Ca2+]M, MEFs were incubated with the mitochondria-specific Ca2+- sensitive cation Rhod-2 (3 M, 25 minutes, 37°C, Invitrogen) and visualized using the same microscopy system as used for Fura-2. Before Rhod-2 loading, cells were transduced with LV encoding mtGFP allowing automated quantitative assessment of mitochondria-specific Rhod-2 emission intensity (Koopman et al., 2008). For fluorescence imaging, a 63  NA 1.25 Plan NeoFluar objective was used. Rhod-2 and mtGFP were alternately excited at 540 and 470 nm. Emission light was directed by 560DRLP (Rhod-2) or 510WB40 (mtGFP) dichroic mirrors and 565ALP (Rhod- 2) or 515ALP (mtGFP) emission filters to the CCD camera. At the end of each measurement, cells were scraped off the coverslip to allow correction for background fluorescence.
\n
\n### Real-time imaging of intracellular NAD(P)H fluorescence
\n
\nIntracellular NAD(P)H autofluorescence was determined as described previously (Visch et al., 2006). NAD(P)H was excited at 360 nm and fluorescence emission was directed by a 415DCLP dichroic mirror through a 510WB40 emission filter onto the CCD camera (routinely, ten fields of cells were imaged per coverslip). Subsequently, the same cells were treated with the complex I inhibitor rotenone (100 nM, 5 minutes) and again 10 fields of cells were imaged. The mean NAD(P)H autofluorescence intensity was quantified in an intracellular, mitochondria-dense, region of interest and in an extracellular region of the same size to correct for background signals.
\n
\n### Live cell imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology
\n
\nTo assess mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology, cells were incubated with the mitochondria-specific cation tetramethyl Rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, 100 nM, 25 minutes, 37°C, Invitrogen). TMRM loading was carried out in the presence of 1 M cyclosporin H to exhibit dye extrusion by P-glycoprotein. Fluorescence imaging was performed with the microscopy system using the settings described for Rhod-2. Routinely, ten fields of cells were analyzed per coverslip. Mitochondrial membrane potential () and morphology were assessed using an established unbiased quantification approach (Koopman et al., 2008). This approach allowed calculation of the mean TMRM fluorescence intensity for each mitochondrial object, the number of mitochondria per cell (Nc), mitochondrial area (AM), mitochondrial mass (MM, given by the product of NC and AM) and mitochondrial form factor (F). Mitochondrial mass was also determined in fixed MEFs. After immunocytochemistry, total fluorescent TOM-20 signal per cell was automatically quantified with the IN cell analyzer 1000 (GE healthcare), as recently described (Gerard et al., 2010).
\n
\n### Live cell quantification of ROS-induced hydroethidine oxidation
\n
\nTo assess the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced hydroethidine (HEt) oxidation, cells were incubated with HT medium containing HEt (10 M, 10 minutes, 37°C; Invitrogen). Fluorescence imaging was carried out with the microscopy system described above using 490 nm excitation light, a 40  NA1.25 Plan NeoFluar objective, a 525DRLP dichroic mirror and a 565ALP emission filter. Routinely, ten fields of cells were analyzed on each coverslip by quantifying the background- corrected mean fluorescence intensity in a cytosolic and mitochondria-rich region.
\n
\n### Biochemical analysis of oxidative phosphorylation complex activity
\n
\nMeasurement of the activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes (Complex I to Complex V) and citrate synthase (CS) was determined in mitochondria- enriched fractions of MEFs and N2a cells, as described previously (Rodenburg, 2010). The specific activity of each enzyme was normalized to protein concentration and expressed as a percentage of the control.
\n
\n### Blue native PAGE, western blot analysis and in-gel activity measurement
\n
\nMitochondrial-enriched protein fractions were isolated from ~3 106 cultured cells (Calvaruso et al., 2008) and loaded on Bis-Tris gels for blue native PAGE and western blotting. Immunoblots were incubated with the following primary antibodies (1 g/ml): anti-complex-I subunit NDUFA9, anti-complex-II subunit 70 kDa Fp (Invitrogen), anti-complex-III core2, anti-complex-IV subunit I, anti-ATP-synthase subunit alpha (Mitosciences) (Nijtmans et al., 2002). Detection of PINK1 was performed with a specific antibody against PINK1 (Novus Biologicals, BC-494, 1:2000 dilution), including a VDAC1 antibody (Calbiochem, 1:10000 dilution) to control for equal loading. In-gel activity of complex I was determined after overnight incubation at room temperature in 2 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml NADH, and 2.5 mg/ml Nitrotetrazolium Blue (Sigma). Gels were washed in distilled water and scanned immediately with the Odyssey Imaging system (Li-Cor).
\n
\n### Immunocytochemistry
\n
\nCells were grown on 12-mm-diameter coverslips and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. After blocking with 10% goat serum in PBS, cells were incubated for 2 hours with primary antibody [1:100 anti-PINK1 (Novus biologicals) and 1:300 anti-TOM-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, FL-145)] in PBS plus 10% goat serum. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibody (1:500 Alexa-Fluor- 488-conjugated antibodies; Invitrogen). Thereafter, the coverslips were mounted on a microscope slide with Mowiol solution (Sigma). Fluorescence was detected with the 488 argon-ion laser with a laser scanning microscopy unit (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss).
\n
\n### Stereotactic surgery
\n
\nStereotactic injection of LV was performed in the striatum of adult C57Bl/6Jtyrc–2J female Pink1+/+ and Pink1–/– mice (Deroose et al., 2006). The following coordinates were used: anteroposterior, 0.5 mm; lateral, 2.0 mm; dorsoventral, 3.0–2.0 mm. 4 l of highly concentrated vector (7 107 pg p24/ml) was injected at a rate of 0.25 l/minute.
\n
\n### In vivo bioluminescence imaging
\n
\nThe mice were imaged in an IVIS 100 system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) as described previously (Deroose et al., 2006). The animals were injected intravenously with D- luciferin (126 mg/kg; Xenogen) dissolved in PBS (15 mg/ml). Subsequently, 1 minute frames were acquired until the maximal signal was reached. The data are reported as the photon flux (photons/second) from a 1.6 cm2 circular region of interest.
\n
\n### Image analysis and statistics
\n
\nImages were processed and analyzed using Image Pro Plus 6.3 software (Media Cybernetics). Statistical analysis and curve fitting were performed using Origin Pro 7.5 (Originlabs). Results from multiple experiments are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. and statistical significance was assessed using the Student’s t-test (Bonferroni corrected) or ANOVA with post-hoc Dunn’s test for intergroup comparisons. Statistical significance level was set as follows: *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

\n## Abstract
\n
\nLoss-of-function mutations in the PINK1 gene lead to recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease. Animal models with depleted PINK1 expression have failed to reproduce significant nigral dopaminergic neu- rodegeneration and clear alpha-synuclein pathology, main characteristics of the disease. In this study, we investigated whether alpha-synuclein pathology is altered in the absence of PINK1 in cell culture and in vivo. We observed that downregulation of PINK1 enhanced alpha-synuclein aggregation and apoptosis in a neuronal cell culture model for synucleinopathy. Silencing of PINK1 expression in mouse substantia nigra using recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors did not induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a long-term study up to 10 months, nor did it enhance or accelerate dopaminergic neurodegeneration after alpha-synuclein overexpression. However, in PINK1 knockout mice, overexpression of alpha- synuclein in the substantia nigra resulted in enhanced dopaminergic neurodegeneration as well as significantly higher levels of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at serine 129 at 4 weeks postinjection. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that total loss of PINK1 leads to an increased sensitivity to alpha- synuclein-induced neuropathology and cell death in vivo.
\n
\n## 1. Introduction
\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is the most prevalent human neuro- degenerative movement disorder, affecting 1%e2% of the world- wide population aged older than 65 years. PD is characterized by the selective and progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), which results in major motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, resting tremor, and gait disturbances. Another neuropathologic cardinal feature of the dis- ease is the presence of alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein)-rich in- clusions, named Lewy bodies (LBs), in the surviving neurons (Spillantini et al., 1997).
\n
\nPD was long considered a sporadic disease with aging and environmental toxins as its main risks factors. However, over the past decade, mutations in several genes, among which a-synuclein and PINK1, have been identified in inherited PD (Farrer, 2006; Gasser, 2009). These genetic forms of the disease account for 5%e10% of the total cases of PD and share features with the sporadic forms of the disease. Although the etiology of PD remains unclear, mounting evidence suggests a similar mechanistic pathway leading to the dopaminergic cell death at the origin of both idiopathic and familial forms of PD, including protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress (Dawson and Dawson, 2003). For this reason, gaining knowledge into the molecular basis of the monogenic forms of PD may facilitate the understanding of the more common sporadic forms of the disease.
\n
\nLoss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding PINK1 (PTEN- induced kinase 1) lead to autosomal recessive PD and have also been identified as a cause of sporadic PD (Valente et al., 2004a, 2004b). The PINK1 gene is located in the PARK6 locus and en- codes a highly conserved putative serine and/or threonine kinase. Because of the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting motif, the protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria, possibly with its kinase domain facing the cytoplasm, allowing possible interactions with cytosolic proteins (Zhou et al., 2008).
\n
\nPINK1 exerts a neuroprotective effect under situations of severe oxidative stress. It has been shown in cells that overexpression of wild-type (WT) PINK1, but not of its PD-associated mutants, pro- tects against apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial toxins (Deng et al., 2005; Haque et al., 2008; Klinkenberg et al., 2010; Plun-Favreau et al., 2007; Pridg- eon et al., 2007; Sandebring et al., 2009; Valente et al., 2004b). More recently, PINK1 was demonstrated to play a crucial role in mitophagy, a cellular process by which mitochondrial structural unity is maintained through selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010).
\nSince the exact molecular mechanism by which PINK1-related effects occur remains largely elusive, several PINK1 loss- of-function animal models have been developed in the past years to contribute to the understanding of human PD. Intriguingly, although fly models lacking PINK1 expression display a drastic phenotype, ranging from mitochondrial dysfunction to significant dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006), the PINK1 knockout and knockdown mouse models developed so far display mild neurodegenerative changes (see, Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2011 for a review). Furthermore, they do not reproduce the main hallmarks of PDd the progressive dopaminergic cell loss in the SN and the presence of LB-like pa- thology. In this context, increased a-synuclein aggregation was reported in synucleinopathy cell culture models in which PINK1 was silenced via RNA interference (Liu et al., 2009) but an elaborate study of a-synuclein toxicity in rodents is still missing.
\n
\nIn the present study, we investigated whether a-synuclein pa- thology differs in the absence of PINK1 in cell culture and in vivo. First, we showed that the downregulation of PINK1 enhances a-synuclein aggregation and cell death in our synucleinopathy cell culture model. Next, we generated PINK1 knockdown mice by local delivery of a rAAV2/7-mediated, microRNA-based, short-hairpin RNA against PINK1, which we have recently optimized to achieve the most potent knockdown ([Heeman et al., 2011](#/window2/10); Osorio et al., 2014). We observed that the prolonged downregulation of PINK1 in mouse SN did not induce dopaminergic cell death in a long-term study up to 10 months. We examined the vulnerability of the nigral dopaminergic neurons to a-synuclein toxicity when the PINK1 levels were reduced or absent. For this approach, we delivered a rAAV2/7-a-synuclein WT vector to the SN of both PINK1 knock- down and PINK1 knockout mice. Our data show that a-synuclein- induced neurodegeneration and neuropathology is enhanced in the PINK1 knockout mice but not after local knockdown in mouse SN.
\n
\n## 2. Methods
\n
\n### 2.1. Lentiviral vector design and production
\n
\nLentiviral (LV) vectors encoding for a-synuclein, PINK1 knock- down, or the empty plasmid pCHMWS-blasticidin (control), under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, were prepared in- house as described earlier with the triple transfection method (Geraerts et al., 2005). The knockdown construct was generated using 2 repeats of a microRNA-based, short-hairpin RNA, hereafter referred to as miR, against PINK1 messenger RNA (mRNA). The artificial multiple-miR hairpins were generated using a micro- RNA30 scaffold as previously described (Sun et al., 2006), in which the target sequence was replaced by 2 miR repeats of a functional short-hairpin sequence against PINK1 previously published (Zhou et al., 2007). Detailed cloning, efficiency, and functionality of the newly generated PINK1 knockdown construct in cell culture has been shown elsewhere (Heeman et al., 2011; Osorio et al., 2014). The LV vectors induced co-expression of the hygromycin selection marker (for a-synuclein) from the same transcript via an internal ribosome entry site or blasticidin (for PINK1 knockdown and control).
\n
\n### 2.2. Generation of polyclonal stable overexpression cell lines using LV vectors
\n
\nHuman neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 50 mg/mL gentamycin (Invitrogen), and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) referred to herein as DMEM-complete, at 37  C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Transduction was performed as previously described (Deleersnijder et al., 2011).
\n
\n### 2.3. Synucleinopathy cell culture model
\n
\nWe used the cell culture model described by Ostrerova-Golts et al. (2000) with minor modifications as previously described (Gerard et al., 2010). Briefly, cells were treated for 72 hours with 100 mM H2O2 and 5 mM freshly prepared FeCl2 in DMEM-complete and filtered through a 0.20-mm filter (Corning Inc, New York, NY, USA). After 3 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Cells were stored in PBS until analysis.
\n
\n### 2.4. High-content analysis of a-synuclein aggregation and cell death
\n
\nTo quantify a-synuclein aggregation and apoptosis in our syn- ucleinopathy cell culture model, we used the IN Cell Analyzer 1000 and IN Cell Investigator software (GE Healthcare) as described before (Gerard et al., 2010).
\n
\n### 2.5. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vector design and production
\n
\nThe plasmids for the rAAV vector production were previously described (Gao et al., 2005). These plasmids include the construct for the AAV2/7 serotype, the AAV transfer plasmid, and the pAdv- DeltaF6 adenoviral helper plasmid. The transfer plasmid encoded either 2 miR repeats against the monomeric red fluorescent protein (miR-ctrl) or against PINK1 (miR-PINK1) preceded by the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), or the human WT a-synuclein transgene. The transfer plasmid also contained the CMVie- enhanced synapsin1 promoter to drive transgene expression and the woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regulatory element.
\n
\nThe viral vectors were produced at the Leuven Viral Vector Core from the KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). Vector production and purification were performed as described in detail elsewhere (Van der Perren et al., 2011). The final titers of the concentrated vector stocks ranged between 6.4 1011 and 2.4 1012 genome copies per milliliter (GC/mL) as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
\n
\n### 2.6. Stereotactic surgery
\n
\nHousing and handling of mice was done in compliance with the European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC) and approved by the Bioethical Committee of the KU Leuven. We have previously described the generation of PINK1 knockout mice (PINK1 / ) and their control littermates (PINK1þ/þ) (Heeman et al., 2011). Female, 8-week-old, C57BL/6 mice were injected with rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl or rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1 vector diluted at 1.5 1011 GC/mL. The human WT a-synuclein rAAV2/7 vector was injected at 4.0 1011 GC/mL in all experiments. The animals were anaesthetized and placed in a stereotactic head frame (Stoelting, IL, USA). After making a midline incision of the scalp, a burr hole was drilled in the appropriate location for the SN at the right site of the skull. Two microliters of viral vector were injected at a rate of 0.25 mL/min with a 30-gauge needle on a 10 mL Hamilton syringe. The needle was left in place for an additional 5 minutes before being slowly withdrawn from the brain. Coordinates for mouse SN were anteroposterior ( 3.1 mm) and mediolateral ( 1.2 mm) relative to bregma, and dorsoventral ( 4.0 mm) from the dural surface (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001). Coordinates for mouse striatum (STR) were anteroposterior (þ0.5 mm), medio- lateral ( 2.0 mm), and dorsoventral ( 3.0 mm).
\n
\n### 2.7. Cylinder test
\n
\nTo examine side bias in spontaneous forelimb use, mice were placed individually inside a glass cylinder (12 cm diameter, 22 cm height) which was positioned in front of 2 vertical mirrors to be able to view the mouse from all angles. No habituation of the ani- mals to the testing cylinder was allowed before video-recording. Video-recordings were examined by an observer blinded to the animal’s identity to count the number of supporting wall touches (contacts with fully extended digits) executed independently with the forelimb ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion.
\n
\n### 2.8. In situ hybridization
\n
\nSequences of antisense and sense digoxigenin-labeled ribop- robes and production using T3 and T7 transcription systems and 1 mg of linearized plasmid were previously described (Taymans et al., 2006). Briefly, mouse frozen brains were sectioned at 12 mm thickness in a cryostat (Cryocut 1800; Cambridge Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). After hybridization, immunodetection was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digox- igenin Fab fragments (1:4000, Roche Diagnostics). Nitroblue tetrazolium and/or bromo-chloro-indolylphosphate (NBT/BCIP, Roche Diagnostics) was used as chromogen. As a control of probe specificity, sections hybridized with antisense probe were accom- panied by adjacent sections hybridized with sense riboprobe. No significant labeling was observed (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The in situ hybridization (ISH) signal was assessed by densitometric analysis using the Image J software (Version 1.45s, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The average densities of striatal or nigral fields in both contralateral and ipsilateral sides were determined. Percentage signal was calculated as ratio of the signal in the ipsilateral versus contralateral side and multiplied by 100.
\n
\n### 2.9. Histology
\n
\nAt selected time points, mice were deeply anesthetized using an overdose of pentobarbital (Nembutal, CEVA Santé, Belgium) and transcardially perfused with saline followed by ice-cold 4% para- formaldehyde in PBS. Immunohistochemistry was performed under uniform conditions on free-floating 50-mmethick coronal brain sections using antibodies raised against GFP (1:10,000, in house), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1:5000, Millipore 152), VMAT-2 (1:1000, abcam 81,855), a-synuclein (1:5000, Millipore 5038), and P-S129 a- synuclein (1:5000, Elan Pharmaceuticals; Anderson et al., 2006; George et al., 2010). After 3% hydrogen peroxide treatment, sec- tions were incubated overnight in primary antibody solution in 10% normal goat serum (DakoCytomation, Belgium). As secondary anti- body, we used biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:600, DakoCytomation), followed by incubation with streptavidin- horseradish peroxidase complex (1:1000, DakoCytomation). TH immunoreactivity was visualized using Vector SG (SK-4700, Vector Laboratories) as chromogen; GFP and (P-S129) a-synuclein immu- noreactivities were visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (0.4 mg/ mL, Sigma-Aldrich). After being rinsed and mounted, the sections were cover-slipped using DPX mounting medium (Sigma).
\nFor fluorescent double staining, sections were rinsed 3 times in PBS and incubated overnight in the dark in PBS-0.1% Triton X-100, 10% goat or donkey serum, and the following antibodies: chicken anti-GFP (1:500, Aves Labs 1020), rabbit anti-a-synuclein (1:1000, Millipore 5038), and mouse anti-TH (1:1000, Millipore MAB318), or mouse anti-a-synuclein (1:100, Invitrogen LB309) and rabbit anti- ubiquitin (1:1000, Dako 20,458). After rinsing, the sections were incubated in the dark for 1 hour in fluorochrome-conjugated sec- ondary antibodies such as donkey anti-chicken FITC (1:400, Lucron), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647, and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 555 (1:400, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), or goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 633 (1:400, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). After being rinsed and mounted, the sections were cover-slipped with Mowiol (Sigma).
\n
\n### 2.10. Stereological quantification and confocal microscopy
\n
\nThe number of TH-, a-synuclein-, and P-S129 a-synuclein-pos- itive cells in the SN was estimated using a random sampling ste- reological counting method, the optical fractionator (Schmitz and Hof, 2005), in a computerized system (StereoInvestigator; Micro- BrightField, Magdeburg, Germany). Coefficient of error attributable to the sampling was calculated according to Gundersen and Jensen (1987). Errors 0.10 were accepted. For each animal, every fourth section throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the SN was incor- porated to the counting procedure. The SN was delineated from  2.54 to  3.88 mm posterior to bregma. The conditions of the experiment were blinded to the investigator. The number of a- synuclein-positive cells in the SN exhibiting LB-like aggregates in the cytoplasm was determined using the optical fractionator at the 100 magnifying lens. Each cell was visually scored for the pres- ence or the absence of aggregates. Examples of an a-synuclein- positive cell without and with aggregates are displayed in Fig. 6B and C, respectively.
\n
\nFluorescent triple immunostaining for a-synuclein, GFP, and TH or double immunostaining for a-synuclein and ubiquitin were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fluoview 1000, Olympus).
\n
\n### 2.11. Statistical analysis
\n
\nStatistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software package. Results are expressed as means standard error of the mean. For the cell culture assay, the nonparametric Kruskal- Wallis test was used followed by a posttest (Dunn) to correct for multiple testing. As for the stereological quantifications, statistical significance was assessed using the Student t-test or 2-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for intergroup comparisons. Statistical significance level was set as follows: * if p < 0.05,**ifp<0.01,and***ifp<0.001.

\n### 3.1. Downregulation of PINK1 enhances a-synuclein-induced aggregation and cell death in a synucleinopathy cell culture model
\n
\nWe have previously optimized a neuronal cell culture assay in which oxidative stress produced by FeCl2 and H2O2 stimulates a- synuclein aggregation (Gerard et al., 2010). To investigate the effect of the absence of PINK1 in this synucleinopathy model, we transduced the SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing a-synuclein with an LV vector encoding a control plasmid or 2 miRNA-based, short- hairpin RNA repeats (miR) against PINK1 (PINK1 knockdown). Knockdown of PINK1 expression was confirmed using a quantita- tive real-time polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 1A). We observed that the downregulation of PINK1 by means of an LV vector significantly increased the aggregation of a-synuclein in the synucleinopathy cell culture model when compared with control (Fig. 1B). In addi- tion, we determined the effect of PINK1 knockdown on nucleus condensation and fragmentation as a measure for cell death (Fig. 1C). Similarly, to the effect on a-synuclein aggregation, the downregulation of PINK1 enhanced the number of late apoptotic cells when compared with control.

\n### 3.2. rAAV2/7 vector-mediated knockdown of PINK1 in mouse SN does not cause behavioral deficits or dopaminergic cell death
\n
\nTo examine whether the downregulation of PINK1 influences a- synuclein neuropathology in vivo, we first studied PINK1 knock- down by itself in adult mouse brain. For this approach, we used the same PINK1 knockdown construct as previously developed in an LV vector for the cell culture assay but now delivered it in mouse SN in the context of a rAAV2/7 vector.
\n
\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our viral vector to silence PINK1 expression in mouse STR and SN, we used ISH because of the lack of reliable and sensitive PINK1 antibodies available for immunohis- tochemical detection of endogenous mouse PINK1. At 2 weeks after injection of the rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1 or rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl in mouse STR or SN, brain tissues were processed for ISH. We observed a robust reduction in the PINK1 signal with the rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1 when compared with the contralateral side or the injected side of rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl (Fig. 2A). Only 23% of PINK1 mRNA in the STR and 9% in the SN remained at 2 weeks after injection when transgene expression is known to be maximal (Fig. 2B).
\n
\nNext, we performed a long-term follow-up study of the down- regulation of PINK1 in mouse SN. We assessed behavioral perfor- mance in the cylinder test at 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months postinjection (Fig. 2C). All groups performed similarly and no impairment was observed. We also monitored the weight of these animals and no differences were observed between groups (data not shown). In addition, we stained the nigral dopaminergic neurons for the dopaminergic marker TH, to evaluate their survival upon PINK1 silencing (Fig. 2E). Stereological quantification of the number of TH- positive neurons in the SN showed no differences over time be- tween groups (Fig. 2D), indicating that PINK1 downregulation by itself does not induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Because both knockdown viral vectors contained the same reporter gene, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for GFP, which enabled us to demonstrate stable transgene expression in the injected area over time (Fig. 2F).
\n
\n### 3.3. Local PINK1 knockdown in mouse SN does not enhance a-synuclein-induced neuropathology
\n
\nWe have previously characterized the delivery of a rAAV2/7-a- synuclein WT vector in adult mouse SN (Oliveras-Salva et al., 2013). We observed that the overexpression of a-synuclein led to a strong and progressive dopaminergic neuron loss in mouse SN, which ranged from 19% to 57% cell death at 4 weeks after injection, depending on the vector dose. In the present study, we used the intermediate vector dilution of the past study for the over- expression of a-synuclein (4.0 1011 GC/mL) that induced 45% TH- positive cell loss at 4 weeks postinjection. We chose this dose because we reasoned that a slow progression of the neuro- degeneration might easily allow us to distinguish possible differ- ences between groups.
\n
\nTo investigate whether a-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration differs when PINK1 is downregulated, we unilaterally coinjected the rAAV2/7-a-synuclein WT vector together with the rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl vector or rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1 vector in mouse SN. We performed fluorescent triple immunos- tainings to assess the expression of both transgenes. At 5 days postinjection, we observed a widespread expression of both a- synuclein and GFP proteins in the injected area (Fig. 3A). Co- localization of a-synuclein and GFP with TH indicated an efficient transduction of the targeted nigral dopaminergic neurons distrib- uted throughout the SN pars compacta.
\n
\nWe assessed the behavioral performance of the mice in the cylinder test at 5 days and 4 weeks postinjection (Fig. 3B). All groups behaved similarly and no clear impairments were observed. Next, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for TH in the SN (Fig. 3C). We observed a progressive and significant dopami- nergic cell loss over time in both groups, which is consistent with the localized overexpression of rAAV2/7-a-synuclein in mouse SN (Fig. 3D). However, no clear differences in the percentage of remaining TH-positive neurons were observed when PINK1 was downregulated compared with controls (miR-ctrl: 23% at 2 weeks and 46% at 4 weeks; miR-PINK1: 26% at 2 weeks and 49% at 4 weeks) (Fig. 3E). To confirm the dopaminergic cell loss and not a TH downregulation we performed a staining for VMAT, another dopaminergic marker. This marker also showed a reduced staining in the SN of the injected side compared with the non-injected side (Supplementary Fig. 3).
\n
\nTo evaluate the expression of the transgene over time in the injected region, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for human a-synuclein. We observed a clear increase in a-synuclein expression at 2 weeks postinjection, followed by a significant decrease at 4 weeks postinjection to a similar extent for both knockdown viral vectors (Fig. 4A). Quantification of the total number a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN did not reveal signifi- cant differences in a-synuclein expression between groups at any of the 3 different time points (Fig. 4C).
\n
\nIn parallel, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for P-S129 a-synuclein (Fig. 4B). This phosphorylated form of a- synuclein at serine residue at position 129 (P-S129) mainly ac- cumulates in the LBs (Anderson et al., 2006; Fujiwara et al., 2002), thus, it is considered as a neuropathologic marker for a- synuclein. Overall, we observed a net increase in the number of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN at 4 weeks post- injection for both knockdown conditions without clear differences between groups (Fig. 4D). When calculating the percentage of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN by determining the ratio between the number of P-S129 a-synu- clein-positive cells (Fig. 4D) and the total number of a-synuclein- positive cells (Fig. 4C) estimated in the SN, the PINK1 knockdown condition displayed an enhanced increase in the percentage of P- S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN, although this was not significant (Fig. 4E). In conclusion, these results indicate that a- synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is not signifi- cantly altered when PINK1 is downregulated. Also, at a later time point of 4 months postinjection, no significant differences in behavioral performance, dopaminergic cell survival, or a-synu- clein expression were observed between groups (data not shown).
\n
\n### 3.4. Enhanced a-synuclein-induced dopaminergic cell death and phosphorylation in PINK1 knockout mice
\n
\nNext to the simultaneous delivery of rAAV2/7-a-synuclein with the PINK1 knockdown vector, we unilaterally injected the a-synu- clein overexpressing viral vector in the SN of PINK1 knockout mice (PINK1 / ) and their WT age-matched control littermates (PINK1þ/þ), which were previously developed by our group (Heeman et al., 2011). To examine the susceptibility of the PINK1 knockout mice to a-synuclein-induced toxicity, we performed immuno- histochemical stainings for TH at 5 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 9 weeks after injection (Fig. 5A). In agreement with the rate of neurodegeneration induced in the PINK1 knockdown or control groups described previously, we observed a progressive and significant loss of the nigral dopaminergic neurons over time in both groups (Fig. 5B). Stereological quantification of the remaining TH-positive neurons showed a differential degree of TH cell loss between groups (Fig. 5C). At 4 weeks after injection, stereological counts revealed a 36% TH-positive neuron loss respective to the contralateral side in WT mice, whereas 49% of the TH-positive nigral cells were lost in the PINK1 knockout mice. A similar trend was observed at 9 weeks postinjection, although this difference was not significant (PINK1þ/þ: 53%; PINK1 / : 60%).
\n
\nNext, we stained the nigral sections for human a-synuclein to evaluate the expression of the transgene over time in the injected region. As expected, we observed an increase in expression until 2 weeks postinjection, followed by a significant decrease at 4 weeks after injection (Fig. 6A and E). Similarly to the dopaminergic cell counts, we observed a more pronounced loss of a-synuclein-posi- tive cells in PINK1 knockout mice when compared with their con- trol littermates at 4 weeks postinjection (PINK1þ/þ: 3350 359; PINK1 / : 2781 449). A similar trend was observed at 9 weeks postinjection, yet not significant (PINK1þ/þ: 2968 206; PINK1 / : 2120 403). Interestingly, a-synuclein expression significantly declined in PINK1 knockout mice at 9 weeks postinjection, whereas the total number of a-synuclein-positive cells did not substantially differ from 4 to 9 weeks postinjection in the WT group.
\n
\nTo investigate the pathologic nature of the remaining a-synuclein- positive cells, we performed fluorescent double immunostainings for a-synuclein and ubiquitin because immunohistochemical studies have shown that ubiquitin is a major constituent of the LB (Spillantini et al., 1997). At 4 weeks postinjection, we visualized a clear co- localization of a-synuclein and ubiquitin (Fig. 6D). In addition, we examined a-synuclein-related pathology by means of 2 stereological quantification methods. Firstly, we estimated the percentage of a- synuclein-positive cells containing aggregates in the SN (Fig. 6FeH). For this approach, we visually scored the nigral a-synuclein-positive cells for the presence of LB-like inclusions in their cytoplasm at high magnification. Examples of an a-synuclein-positive cell without and with aggregates are displayed in Fig. 6B and C, respectively. We observed a progressive increase over time in the percentage of aggregate-positive cells in the SN for both conditions. This was slightly enhanced in PINK1 knockout mice throughout the whole time course of the experiment (PINK1þ/þ: 18% at 5 days, 22% at 2 weeks, 37% at 4 weeks, and 50% at 9 weeks; PINK1 / : 21% at 5 days, 32% at 2 weeks, 42% at 4 weeks, and 56% at 9 weeks) (Fig. 6F).
\nSubsequently, we stained for P-S129 a-synuclein in the SN and we observed a progressive increase over time for both groups up to 4 weeks after injection (Fig. 7A and B). Likewise, the estimation of the percentage of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN revealed a gradual increase over time for both groups up to 4 weeks postinjection (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the 9 weeks time point exhibited less P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells for both conditions, but it was more substantially reduced in the PINK1 knockout mice. We have previously reported that a maximum is reached in the number of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells following delivery of this rAAV2/7-a-synuclein vector in mice, after which the vast cell death (over 50% dopaminergic neuron loss) affects the P-S129 a- synuclein counts (Oliveras-Salvá M. et al., 2013). The total number and the percentage of phosphorylated S129 a-synuclein-positive cells was significantly higher in the SN of PINK1 knockout mice compared with WT mice at 4 weeks postinjection. In addition, PINK1 knockout mice showed a trend to an enhanced increase in the percentage of phosphorylated S129 a-synuclein-positive cells at all time points (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results indicate that complete in vivo depletion of PINK1 sensitizes the dopaminergic neurons to a-synuclein-induced cell death and neuropathology.
\n
\n## 4. Discussion
\n
\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate whether a- synuclein neuropathology differs in the absence of PINK1 in cell culture and in vivo. We showed that the downregulation of PINK1 enhanced a-synuclein aggregation and apoptotic cell death in a neuronal cell culture model for synucleinopathy. This result is in agreement with a previous study reporting that the loss of PINK1 leads to increased detergent-insoluble aggregates in a neuronal cell culture model overexpressing either WT or A53T a-synuclein (Liu et al., 2009). In vivo, we reported that PINK1 knockdown does not lead to dopaminergic cell death by itself nor enhance the dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by rAAV2/7 vector-mediated overexpression of WT a- synuclein. In contrast, we observed that PINK1 knockout mice are more vulnerable to a-synuclein-induced cell death and neuropathology.
\n
\nThe identification of gene mutations leading to rare Mendelian forms of PD has impelled the development of several animal models. In the case of PINK1, fly, worm, and fish models exhibit a robust phenotype with neurodegeneration, motor deficits, mito- chondrial impairment, and vulnerability to toxins (Anichtchik et al., 2008; Park et al., 2006; Sallinen et al., 2010; Samann et al., 2009; Xi et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2006). Conversely, PINK1 knockout and knockdown mice developed so far are characterized by a mild phenotype with mitochondrial deficits and sensitivity to oxidative stress-inducing toxins (Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2011). They do not reproduce the main features of PDd the progressive degeneration of the nigral dopaminergic neurons and the presence of cyto- plasmic a-synuclein-rich inclusions. Only a nonsignificant increase in a-synuclein protein levels but in contrast, a relevant decrease in mRNA levels has been reported in the brain stem and midbrain of 2- year-old PINK1 knockout mice (Gispert et al., 2009). These results suggest that a-synuclein degradation and resynthesis might be impaired, indicating a hurdle in protein clearance. In patients with sporadic PD and PD associated with heterozygous PINK1 mutations, PINK1 has been detected in LBs (Gandhi et al., 2006; Murakami et al., 2007). The sole neuropathologic report from a PD patient with homozygous PARK6 mutations showed that PINK1-linked PD induces LB pathology (Samaranch et al., 2010).
\n
\nWe reasoned that adult knockdown of PINK1 might induce a more severe phenotype because of the acute nature of the knockdown with less opportunity for compensatory changes. Indeed, adult local loss of parkin function was shown to result in dopaminergic cell loss after 10 months (Shin et al., 2011). In the past, we have used lentiviral vectors for stable and long-term silencing of target genes in the cen- tral nervous system using short-hairpin RNAs (Van den Haute et al., 2003). RNA interference is a mechanism present in all eukaryotic cells to halt the expression of targeted genes, which involves pro- cessing of so-called microRNA structures (He and Hannon, 2004). Thus, the use of artificial microRNAs might provide a better tool for targeted gene silencing studies in vivo as they mimic the natural process ongoing in the cell (McBride et al., 2008). In addition, we have shown that rAAV vectors efficiently transduce nigral dopaminergic neurons (Van der Perren et al., 2011). Based on this, we selected the rAAV2/7 serotype because of its high transduction efficiency of the dopaminergic neurons in vivo, and we combined it with an optimized miR-based construct (Heeman et al., 2011) (Osório et al., 2014). Here, we reported the development and characterization of a PINK1 knockdown mouse by delivery of a specific miR-based rAAV2/7 vector. We have successfully shown efficient knockdown of PINK1 both in STR and SN of adult mouse. However, this did not induce dopami- nergic neurodegeneration in the time scope of our study. Previous studies have reported the absence of neurodegeneration in the SN of PINK1 knockout mice up to 19 months old (Akundi et al., 2011; Gispert et al., 2009; Glasl et al., 2012; Kitada et al., 2007). A recent report mimicking PINK1 loss-of-function via short-hairpin RNA adenoviral vector delivery in mouse striatum also failed to reproduce a significant dopaminergic neurodegeneration (Haque et al., 2012). Taking into account the role of PINK1 in mitochondrial stability, we cannot discard that the depletion of PINK1 expression might induce subtle cellular modifications not visible at the phenotypic level.
\n
\nPINK1 knockout mice have shown susceptibility to oxidative stress and vulnerability to neurotoxins (Gautier et al., 2008; Haque et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a-synuclein neurotoxicity in the absence of PINK1 in vivo via 2 parallel approaches. We injected a rAAV2/7-a-synuclein vector in the SN of both PINK1 knockout and knockdown mice. We have previously shown that delivery of rAAV2/7-a-synuclein vector in mouse SN triggers a robust and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as marked a-synuclein-related neuropathology (Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2013). We now report that the complete ablation of PINK1 sensitizes the nigral neurons to a-synuclein toxicity. Because rAAV2/7-a-synuclein induced the same rate of neurodegeneration after local PINK1 knockdown as in the control group, we suggest that the remaining PINK1 is sufficient to maintain the dopaminergic cell function within the time frame of our study.
\n
\nOver the last years, much attention has been dedicated to the study of mitochondrial dysfunction as an important cause of the dopaminergic cell death seen in PD patients. To date, it is still un- known how a-synuclein mediates its cytotoxic effects, but it has been reported that a-synuclein causes cytochrome c release and reduces mitochondrial complex I activity, indicating that a- synuclein also regulates mitochondrial function and dynamics (Devi et al., 2008; Parihar et al., 2008). Although the link between a- synuclein pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction remains unclear, several groups have demonstrated that, in pathologic conditions, a-synuclein can translocate to the mitochondria via an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting that it might interfere with mitochondrial function (Cole et al., 2008; Devi et al., 2008). In worms, mitochondrial fragmentation induced by expression of a-synuclein is rescued by co-expression of PINK1 (Kamp et al., 2010). In flies, overexpression of PINK1 rescues motor and developmental defects induced by a-synuclein (Todd and Staveley, 2008, 2012). PINK1 plays a crucial role in mitochondrial viability by the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria in concert with parkin in a cellular autophagic process called mitophagy (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2010). In addition, PINK1 has been described to exert a neuro- protective and pro-survival effect under situations of oxidative stress-induced cell death via several proteins and pathways. Recent findings have shown that the mitochondrial chaperone protein TRAP1, substrate of PINK1, mitigates motor deficits and dopami- nergic neurodegeneration in A53T a-synuclein-expressing flies (Butler et al., 2012). Phosphorylation of TRAP1 by PINK1 protects the mitochondria against cell death induced by oxidative stress and prevents cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Pridgeon et al., 2007).
\n
\nTaken together, we have shown that a-synuclein neuropa- thology is exacerbated in the absence of PINK1. Whether there is a direct interaction of PINK1 and a-synuclein awaits further research, but our findings might help to elucidate the link between mito- chondrial dysfunction and a-synucleinopathy in mammalian brain and provide new therapeutic targets.

\n### Abstract
\n
\nMutations, duplication and triplication of α-synuclein genes are linked to familial Parkinson’s disease (PD), and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in Lewy bodies (LB) is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The targeted overexpression of α-syn in the substantia nigra (SN) mediated by viral vectors may provide a better alternative to recapitulate the neurodegenerative features of PD. Therefore, we overexpressed human wild-type α-syn using rAAV2/1 vectors in the bilateral SN of mouse and examined the effects for up to 12 weeks. Delivery of rAAV-2/1-α-syn caused significant nigrostriatal degeneration including appearance of dystrophic striatal neurites, loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons and dissolving nigral neuron bodies in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the α-syn overexpressed mice also developed significant deficits in motor function at 12 weeks when the loss of DA neurons exceeded a threshold of 50%. To investigate the sensitivity to neurotoxins in mice overexpressing α-syn, we performed an MPTP treatment with the subacute regimen 8 weeks after rAAV injection. The impact of the combined genetic and environmental insults on DA neuronal loss, striatal dopamine depletion, dopamine turnover and motor dysfunction was markedly greater than that of either alone. Moreover, we observed increased phosphorylation (S129), accumulation and nuclear distribution of α-syn after the combined insults. In summary, these results reveal that the overexpressed α-syn induces progressive nigrostriatal degeneration and increases the susceptibility of DA neurons to MPTP. Therefore, the targeted overexpression of α-syn and the combination with environmental toxins may provide valuable models for understanding PD pathogenesis and developing related therapies.
\n
\n### Introduction
\n
\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related and the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Clinical manifestations include motor impairments involving bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and postural instability. Progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and formation of Lewy Bodies (LB), which are cytoplasmic inclusions mainly containing α-synuclein (α-syn), are the pathological hallmarks of PD [1]. Duplication, triplication and mutations of α-synuclein genes are implicated in familial early-onset PD patients [2, 3] and genome-wide association studies also suggest a critical linkage between α- syn and PD pathogenesis [4, 5]. Studies have also implicated that the overexpressed wild-type, mutated or truncated α-syn contributes to cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo, which further suggests that elevated α-syn is involved in the pathogenesis of PD [6–9].
\n
\nAlthough transgenic mice overexpressing wild type or mutated forms of α-syn have been produced, most of them have failed to replicate key pathological features such as the progressive loss of nigrostriatal DA neurons and neurites [10, 11]. With the exception of different forms and expression levels of α-syn, it’s probable that some compensatory mechanisms during development have counteracted the toxic effects caused by transgenes in these models. Therefore, conditional knockouts or viral vector mediated delivery of related genes may be an alternative approach to generate animal models that closely reproduce PD-like neurodegeneration[12]. To date, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus have been used to overexpress α-syn in rats, and these models have replicated many PD-like pathological features [13–16]. However, the viral vector generated models show variability in neurodegeneration degrees and time frames [6, 13, 14, 17–20].
\n
\nMost cases of PD are sporadic, which suggests a linkage between environmental factors and the pathogenesis. Exposure to pesticides such as rotenone, paraquat and maneb correlates with an increased incidence for PD [21], thus these agents have been used to generate PD-like animal models [22, 23]. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been discovered to induce human parkinsonism [24, 25], since then it has been used for modeling parkinsonism in rodents and non-human primates [26, 27]. Genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental toxins probably contribute to the pathogenesis in combination
\n
\nIn the present study, we used the rAAV2/1 vector to overexpress human wild type α-syn in the bilateral SN of mice. Since PD affects the brain bilaterally, bilateral lesions mimic the real pathological situations and behavior tests used for bilateral lesions are usually easy to perform. The overexpression of α-syn led to a progressive loss of nigral DA neurons and striatal TH positive neurites accompanied by motor behavior deficits during a period of 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the neurotoxin MPTP was administered to investigate the sensitivity of mice overexpressing α-syn. We observed a significant decrease in striatal dopamine, and a substantial loss of DA neurons and neurites after MPTP treatment. The evaluation of DA neuron survival, striatal tyrosine hydroxylase expression, dopamine levels, and phosphorylated and accumulated forms of α-syn revealed an increased vulnerability to the neurotoxin MPTP in the α-syn overexpression mice.

\n### Materials and Methods
\n##### Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/1 preparation and cell culture
\n
\nThe production of recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/1 (rAAV2/1) vectors were previously described [28]. Briefly, a human α-syn gene which was obtained previously [29] or GFP was inserted into the transfer plasmid to construct pSNAV- α-syn or pSNAV-EGFP, which encoded α-syn or EGFP transgene under the control of the CMV promoter. The transfer Targeted Overexpression of α-Synuclein and Vulnerability to MPTP PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0131281 June 26, 2015 2 / 19 Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (No. 20121106130001), Yunnan Natural Science Foundation (2013FZ132, 2011FB116), Beijing Key Laboratory of New Drug Mechanisms and Pharmacological Evaluation Study (BZ0150), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (3332013082, 3332013146) and Graduate Innovation Fund 2012 of Peking Union Medical College (2012-1007-003). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. plasmids were transfected into BHK-21 cells (ATCC) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), then the confluent cells were infected by helper virus HSV1-rc/4UL2, which was essential for viron packaging. Cultures were collected until all of the cells were easy to fall into medium by vigorous shaking. The rAAV2/1- α-syn and rAAV2/1-EGFP vectors were purified by chloroform and NaCl. Chloroform (10%, v/v) was added to the collected cells, which were incubated at 37°C with vigorously shaking until all cells were lysed. Then solid NaCl was added till the final concentration was 1 mol/L by shaking at room temperature. The supernatant was harvested and PEG 8000 was added and centrifuged, then discarded the supernatant. Re-suspend the pellets in PBS buffer and add DAase I and RNase to obtain the final concentration of 1 μg/ mL, then the culture was incubated for 30 minutes. An equal volume of chloroform was added to the suspension and the organic aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phases containing the rAAV vectors were collected and referred to as the purified stock. Then dot blot hybridization was used to determine the genome particles of virus. The final titer for both vectors were 3.1×1011 genome copies/ml, aliquoted viruses were stored at -80°C and kept on ice during surgery.
\n
\nHEK293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.
\n
\n### Animals and surgical procedures
\nAdult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 18–22g were used for surgery and housed four to five per cage with access to food and water during a 12h light/dark cycle. Before surgery, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Then they were placed in a stereotaxic flame and the rAAV vectors were injected into the SN using the 10μl Hamilton syringe. 2μl rAAV2/1-α-syn solutions were infused bilaterally at a rate of 0.2μl/min and the needle was left for an additional 10mins before it was retracted. The same volume of rAAV2/1-EGFP vectors were infused bilaterally as the control group. All injections were made into the substantia nigra at stereotaxic coordinates: AP -3.2mm, ML 1.4mm, and DV -4.5mm below dura.
\n
\nMice injected with rAAV2/1-EGFP and rAAV2/1-α-syn vectors were used to investigate the sensitivity to neurotoxin MPTP. These mice were treated with 30mg/kg free base MPTP or saline for 5 consecutive days (i.p.) after 8 weeks of vector infusion and the animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after the last MPTP injection. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of National Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals and animal study was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All efforts were made to minimize suffering.
\n
\n### Behavioral testing
\nOpen-field test. Locomotion activity was assessed in the open field apparatus at 4, 8, 12 weeks after vectors injection. A white plastic box (50×50×30 cm) was used and the area was divided into 25 grids of 100cm2. Mouse was placed individually in the center of the box andtheir behavior was video-taped, the following behavioral parameters were measured manually during the subsequent 5 min in normal lighting: horizontal locomotion (number of grids crossed) and the rearing frequencies (rearing activity). The equipment was cleaned with 70% alcohol and water between trials to avoid olfactory issues.
\n
\nSwim test. Swim test was carried out in plastic containers [30]. The depth of water was 12cm and the temperature was maintained 22–25°C. Each mouse was scored in 1-min for 3 times with an interval of 10 mins. The score was a modification of that used by Marshall and Targeted Overexpression of α-Synuclein and Vulnerability to MPTP PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0131281 June 26, 2015 3 / 19 Berrios: continuous swimming, 3; occasional floating, 2.5; floating time >50% of testing, 2; occasional swimming, 1.5; occasional swimming using hind limbs while floating on one side, 1; hind part sinks with head floating, 0. The observer was blind to the tested mice.
\n
\nPole test. A wood pole which was 50cm long and 1cm in diameter was used in pole test. It was wrapped in gauze to avoid slipping and mouse was put on the top ball of the pole. The time the mouse turned its nose down (inversion time) and the total time to climb down the pole were recorded. The mouse was guided if it didn’t move in 1min. Mice were all pre-trained before surgery, and during test each mouse performed 3 trials with an interval of 5 min. Three trials were averaged for statistical analyses.
\n
\n### Immunochemistry and immunofluorescence
\n
\nMice were anesthetized using chloral hydrate (400mg/kg, i.p.) and then perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde with 3% w/v sucrose. Then the brain was moved and post-fixed in 20% sucrose (20% w/v in 4% paraformaldehyde) overnight. The brains were changed into 40% sucrose solution (40% w/v in 4% paraformaldehyde) after sinking.
\n
\nBrains were sectioned on a freezing microtome (Leica) at thickness of 35μm. Floating sections were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min followed by three washes of PBS, then incubated with 3% normal goat serum blocking for one hour. After that, the sections were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4°C. The antibodies were against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:200, sc-14007, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) or GFP (1:500, G6539, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), human α-syn (1:500, Syn204, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), mice and human α- syn (1:200, sc-7011-R, Santa Cruz), phospho- α-syn (1:200, phosphor-S129, ab51253, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN) (1:500, MAB377, Millipore, Temecula, CA). Sections were rinsed three times in 0.1% tween 20-PBS and then incubated with HRP labeled secondary antibodies (1:200) 2 hours at room temperature. After washes, sections were visualized using 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and coverslipped.
\n
\nFluorescence immunostaining was performed as above without quenching, the Alexa488 or 546 conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:200, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used in the dark. The slides were examined using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM).
\n
\n### Unbiased stereology
\n
\nNumbers of TH-positive neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were estimated using Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience, USA) as described[31]. We used one in six sections to assess the number of TH neurons in SNpc of both hemisphere and the counts were made automatically within a counting frame of 100μm×100μm area. A systematic random sample area was created by the Stereo Investigator which randomly positioned the counting frame within the SNpc under a magnification of 40×. The z-dimension of the counting brick was defined 16μm and a 2μm guard was used. Cells were counted within TH staining outlines and the total estimates were obtained. Density of striatal TH-positive fibers was measured by densitometry using Image-pro plus software 6.0. The values were corrected for non-specific background staining values from cortex. The rAAV-GFP injected mice were used as control.
\n
\n### Western Blotting
\n
\nMice were sacrificed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after vector injection and 2 weeks after the last MPTP treatment, brains were removed rapidly and midbrain and bilateral striatum were dissected quickly then snap-frozen on dry ice. Tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (with protease inhibitor cocktail, phosphatase inhibitors and PMSF). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C Targeted Overexpression of α-Synuclein and Vulnerability to MPTP and the supernatants were stored at -80°C. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay and proteins were boiled for 5 min in loading buffer. A total of 20μg proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 3% BSA 2 hours, membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-TH (1:500, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), anti-dopamine transporter (DAT) (1:500, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), anti-human α-syn (1:500, CST, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4°C. After washing in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20) with gentle agitation, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. The bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE). Densitometric analysis of each protein was conducted using Gel-pro analyzer software (Media Cybernetics).
\n
\n### Nissl staining
\n
\nBrain sections were stained with cresyl violet and washed in distilled water, then dehydrated through graded alcohols (70%, 95% and 100%), placed in xylene and coverslipped. The counting frame of 100μm×100μm area was used within the SNpc under a magnification of 40μ and normal neuronal bodies were identified by size. One in six sections was used for neuronal counting and the analysis was performed on six mice of each group. The rAAV-GFP transduced mice of 12 weeks were used as control.
\n
\n### HPLC
\n
\nDopamine and metabolites were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (Waters 2465 electrochemical detector). Mice were sacrificed and striatal tissues were dissected and quickly frozen in liquid N2. Samples were homogenized in 0.1M perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered and 20μl of it was injected into Waters e2685 separations module equipped with a Diamonsil (5μ,100A) C18 HPLC column (150×4.60mm) as previously described [21, 32]. The mobile phase of HPLC contains 85mM citric acid, 100mM anhydrous sodium acetate, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM octane-1-sulfonic acid, 15% (v/v) methanol in distilled water, pH3.68, and the flow rate was 1.0mL/min. A standard curve generated from injection of standards of highest purity was used for the quantification.

\n### Results
\n##### Efficient overexpression of α-syn or GFP after delivery of rAAV vectors
\n
\nrAAV2/1-α-syn vectors were firstly transduced to HEK293 cells to verify the overexpression of α-syn, and rAAV2/1-EGFP vectors were used as the negative control. We analyzed total cell lysates by western blotting and the result revealed that full length human α-syn was highly expressed in rAAV2/1-α-syn vectors transduced cells but not in cells transduced by rAAV2/ 1-EGFP vectors (Fig 1A). After that, we investigated the effect of overexpressed α-syn in SN at 4 (S1 Fig) and 8 weeks. The expression of α-syn or GFP were evaluated by performing double immunofluorescence staining. Co-immunoreactive staining of human α-syn and TH showed a significant loss of TH-positive neurons in the SNpc, but we also observed an efficient overexpression in the surviving nigral neurons of rAAV2/1-α-syn infected mice (Fig 1I, 1J and 1K). In contrast, neither human α-syn positive staining nor loss of TH positive neurons appeared in the SN of uninjected mice (Fig 1C, 1D and 1E). And we observed a high expression ofGFP with no insult in the SN of rAAV2/1-EGFP infected mice (Fig 1F, 1G and 1H). These results demonstrated an efficient transduction of α-syn or GFP in nigral DA neurons.
\n
\n### The overexpression of α-syn induces progressive loss of nigral neurons,
\nstriatal neurites and morphological changes of neurons in SNpc
\n
\nMice were sacrificed for histological analysis at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after delivery of rAAV2/1-α-syn or rAAV2/1-EGFP vectors. Immunohistochemical staining for TH revealed that the overexpression of α-syn induced a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc compared with the GFP injected control (Fig 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F). And the quantifications indicated a significant loss of TH+ neurons in SNpc at 8 weeks (34% reduction; P<0.001 compared to control) and the deficit was more pronounced at 12 weeks (50% reduction, P<0.001) (Fig 2G). Furthermore, protein levels of TH and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the midbrain also largely depleted at 8 and 12 weeks after rAAV-α-syn transduction (Fig 3A). We also observed more dissolving and disappearing nissl bodies in neurons of SNpc 12 weeks after α-syn overexpression (Fig 3M, 3N and 3O) and cell counting showed significant decrease of normal neuronal bodies in the SNpc of α-syn overexpressing mice (Fig 3P), which demonstrating a progressively developed insult to nigral neurons.
\n
\nTo evaluate the impact of α-syn on axonal terminals of nigral DA neurons, optical density of striatal TH-positive fibers was assessed (Fig 2H, 2I, 2J, 2K, 2L and 2M). Similar to the results observed in neurons of the SNpc, TH staining density of striatal fibers reduced gradually over time. Loss of striatal TH positive  fibers was observed ranging from 10% at 4 weeks to 25% at 8 weeks (P<0.01) and a marked reduction of 45% at 12 weeks(P<0.001) (Fig 2N).
\n
\n### Impaired motor behavior induced by α-syn overexpression
\n
\nWe performed varieties of behavioral tests to evaluate the functional effects of overexpressing α-syn or GFP in nigral neurons, and the mice were tested at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after injection. We found that mice overexpressing α-syn showed deficient locomotor activities compared to control group at 4 (Fig 4A, 170±26.7 vs. 205±29.5 squares) and 8 weeks (164±17.3 vs. 212±30.3 squares) in open field test, moreover, a significant decrease was observed at 12 weeks (104 ±14.2 vs. 195±26.9, P<0.01). In addition, the rearing activities in open field test also decreased significantly at 12 weeks (Fig 4B, 30±3.6 vs. 62±5.1, P<0.001). The locomotor deficiency was compatible with a loss of 50% DA neurons at 12 weeks. Pole test is often used in MPTP treated rodents models to indicate bradykinesia.  Mice in the α-syn group showed a delayed time to descend the pole and a lower score of the behavior on the pole (data not shown). The total time to climb down the pole increased significantly at 12 weeks (Fig 4C, 12.2±0.78s compared to 9.1±0.52s, P<0.01). Furthermore, scores in swim test (Fig 4D) also reduced significantly at 8 (P<0.05) and 12 weeks(P<0.01). These data demonstrated that progressive loss of DA neurons triggered by α-syn overexpression impaired the motor behavior function.
\n
\n### Combination of MPTP and overexpressed α-syn leads to more loss of
\nDA neurons and decline in motor function
\n
\nAbnormal α-syn was widely observed in neurotoxin induced PD models including the rodent MPTP model[33, 34], however, conflicting results on the sensitivity to MPTP were obtained in human α-syn overexpressing mice[35, 36]. One of the possibilities associated with the contradiction results may be the different patterns among α-syn overexpression models. To find whether α-syn overexpression mediated by rAAV vectors could make nigrostriatal system more susceptible to environmental neurotoxin, we treated the mice MPTP in a subacute regimen at 8 weeks after rAAV-α-syn infusion, when modest decline of nigrostriatal system was observed. Then behavioral activities were assessed after injections of 5 consecutive days (once per day), and during which time the body weight of mice treated with MPTP decreased slightly (Fig 5A). Twenty-four hours after the last MPTP injection, mice in α-syn-MPTP group didn’t exhibit significantly increased time to descend the pole compared to the other three groups. While on the 14th day after the last MPTP injection, mice of α-syn-MPTP showed a declined motor behavior in pole test and the time to descend the pole significantly increased compared to mice in control (6.83±0.66 vs. 3.93±0.35s, P<0.001), α-syn (6.83±0.66 vs. 4.74±0.37,P<0.01), and control-MPTP (6.83±0.66 vs. 5.09±0.40, P<0.05) groups (Fig 5B). Locomotor activities in open-field test reduced 2 and 14 days after the last MPTP injection, rearing activities showed a notable decrease too (Fig 5C and 5D). Behavior tests suggested increased motor impairments to MPTP after the overexpression of α-syn. To evaluate the pathological alterations of MPTP and α-syn to nigrostriata system, we assessed the TH positive neurons in SNpc after MPTP treatment. We found more loss of TH positive neurons in the SNpc of α-syn-MPTP group compared with the α-syn group (Fig 5E, 5F, 5G, 5H and 5I) (75% reduction vs. 29% reduction, Newman-Keuls post-hoc test, P<0.001) and control-MPTP group (75% reduction vs.  reduction, P<0.001). Consistent with lesions of nigral DA neurons, a similar reduction of TH protein in striatum of α-syn-MPTP mice was also detected by western blotting (Fig 6A and 6B).
\n
\n### Biochemical impairments after MPTP treatment
\n
\nTo determine the impact of MPTP on dopamine synthesis, storage and turnover, striatal dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxytryptamin (5-HT) were assessed by HPLC (Table 1). Consistent with the motor impairment, a reduction of striatal DA level in MPTP mice was found (1.60±0.12 vs. 12.22±0.89 ng/mg, P<0.001), and the depletion was more pronounced in the α-syn-MPTP group (0.87±0.12 vs. 12.22±0.89ng/mg, P<0.001). Additionally, we found a significant increase in DA turnover, as measured by DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios (Fig 6C). Ratio of DOPAC/DA exhibited an increase of 14 times in mice of α-syn-MPTP group compared to control, while the ratio of mice in MPTP group just increased approximately 8 times. And the HVA/DA ratio revealed a similar change to the DOPAC/DA ratio. The notable changes revealed a more pronounced inhibitory effect on neurotransmitters triggered by combination of MPTP and α-syn.
\n
\n### Combination with MPTP induces more phosphorylation, accumulation and nuclear distribution of α-syn
\n
\nAbnormal aggregation of α-syn is linked to its toxicity in animal models of PD and double fluorescence immunostaining was performed to visualize the condition of α-syn in DA neurons in SNpc. Though toxic forms of α-syn are not clearly confirmed, oligomeric, phosphorylated and other posttranslational modifications of α-syn may all contribute to lesions of DA neurons [37–39], and cell distribution of α-syn may also impact the neuronal toxicity. We found the overexpression of α-syn was maintained after MPTP treatment and the staining
\nsizes increased surrounding the nucleus in α-syn transduced neurons (Fig 7D, 7E and 7F).
\nMeanwhile, more α-syn positive accumulations were observed distributing in nucleus of neurons
\nin the SNpc of α-syn+MPTP group (Fig 7J, 7K and 7L). Nuclear aggregation of α-syn
\nmay be toxic to neurons according to researches by Kontopoulos and Ma [40, 41]. Previous studies have shown that aggregation of α-syn can induce damage to mitochondria, autophagy, ubiquitin-protease system as well as production of ROS, thus destroy the normal function of neurons and contribute to neuronal degeneration [42, 43]. After that, we visualized the phosphorylated forms in nigral DA neurons with an antibody specific for phosphor-Ser129- α-syn (Fig 8A, 8D, 8G and 8J). In α-syn+MPTP mice, we detected pronounced staining of phosphorylated forms distributing both in cytoplasm and nucleus of DA neurons, in which the TH staining was markedly decreased (Fig 8J, 8K and 8L). Moreover, phosphorylated α-syn was also detected in DA neurons of rAAV- α-syn and MPTP group (Fig 8D, 8E, 8F, 8G, 8H and 8I), while none was observed in DA neurons of control mice (Fig 8A, 8B and 8C). Consistent with the immunofluorescence staining, quantification for protein levels of the phosphorylated forms in midbrain of α-syn+MPTP mice also supported the significant accumulation (Fig 8M and 8N).
\n
\n### Discussion
\nIn the current study, we have induced widespread overexpression of human wild type α-syn in the mouse SN by stereotaxic delivery of rAAV2/1 vectors. A progressive lesion of DA neurons in the SNpc was observed after rAAV2/1- α-syn injection, and the loss of TH positive neurons in the SNpc increased from 30% at 8 weeks to nearly 50% at 12 weeks. Long term effects of the overexpressed α-syn consisted of degeneration of DA neurons in the SNpc, appearance of striatal dystrophic neurites throughout and motor dysfunction. Comparing to previous unilateral models, we performed a bilateral rAAV2/1- α-syn administration. The bilateral insults are similarto the situations in clinical patients and motor activities are easy detected in the behavioral experiments. Rodent models of PD by overexpressing α-syn in the nigrostriatal pathway using viral vectors are usually unilateral models. The overexpression of human α-syn in bilateral SN led to significant motor impairments and pathological damages in our study, however, most unilateral lesions by rAAV induced α-syn overexpression with comparative titers showed minimal neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments [6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 44]. The bilateral lesions may produce more damage than unilateral lesions and behavioral impairments may be more significant. In addition to bilateral lesions, different rAAV systems which could influence the
\ntransduction efficacy should also be considered.
\n
\nModels based on rAAV mediated overexpression of human wild-type α-syn exhibit different timeframes and severity of pathology [6, 12, 14, 16, 17, 44]. The variability is most likely due to distinct serotypes of the rAAV virus as well as the different promoters and enhancers, which all lead to diverse transduction efficacy and selectivity of neurons. In addition, dosedependent degeneration after rAAV- α-synuclein delivery has been implicated in research by Oliveras, which has demonstrated that the expression levels of α-syn notably influence the rates of neurodegeneration [17]. Moreover, rats, mice and non-human primates subjected to the same administration may display different time-courses of changes. It has been shown that the expression levels of α-syn should be considered as a primary factor in determining the extent and time-span of neurodegeneration.
\n
\nIn addition to triggering degeneration of DA neurons and neurites, the overexpression of α-syn led to dysfunction of motor activities monitored in spontaneous behavioral tests. Motor behavior impairments appeared to be significant at 12 weeks after injection of rAAV2/1- α-syn
\n
\nvectors. Previous studies have shown that only more than half loss of DA neurons or depletion of striatal DA was sufficient to induce significant behavioral manifestations. So in most instances, virus-mediated models of α-synuclein overexpression do not display significant behavioral deficits [45].
\n
\nEtiology of PD is complex, both clinical and experimental studies have proposed that the interactions between genetic and environmental factors are involved in the disease. Neurotoxins such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), MPTP, rotenone and paraquat can mimic one or more characteristics of PD, thus they are widely used to create PD models. MPTP is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium ion (MPP+) by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) in glia and serotonergic neurons after crossing the blood–brain barrier [46]. And MPP+ is released into extracellular space and selectively transported into neurons by DAT [47]. It inhibits function of mitochondria complex I and induces oxidative stress, thus to exert cytotoxic effects [48].
\n
\nC57BL/6 mice are more sensitive to MPTP than rats, and three MPTP regimens have been used to induce nigrostriatal damage: acute, subacute and chronic [27]. MPTP models are not sufficient to produce progressive neurodegeneration, therefore nigrostriatal lesions are usually detected one or two days after the last MPTP injection, and partial recovery has been observed in acute and subacute regimens at longer time points after MPTP administration [49]. Therefore, we treated the rAAV- α-syn transduced mice with MPTP to investigate the impact of combined genetic and environmental insults.
\n
\nMPTP administration after α-syn overexpression induced greater nigrostriatal impairments compared to the α-syn+saline and control+MPTP groups, and deficits in motor activities were observed in pole and open field test 14 days after the last injection. Moreover, a neurochemical analysis indicated markedly decreased striatal DA levels and increased DA turnover after MPTP administration. These results demonstrate an increased susceptibility of mice to MPTP after nigral α-syn overexpression. In addition, our findings suggest that the neurotoxin MPTP induces more striatal DA reduction than α-syn. Phosphorylation of α-syn at the serine residue in position 129, a post-transcriptional modification, is also considered to be associated with α-syn pathology [50–52]. Positive staining of S129-phosphorylated x-syn increased significantly after the combined treatment of α-syn and MPTP. Some in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that the phosphorylated form of α-syn is toxic to DA neurons [53–55].
\n
\nThe overexpression of α-syn can induce increased oxidative stress and decreased mitochondria complex I activity. The oxidative stress in turn may induce α-syn to aggregate into toxic forms, which would further damage mitochondria and produce more ROS [56, 57]. Therefore, the overexpressed α-syn probably leads to impaired mitochondria more vulnerable to MPTP and induces more insults. Furthermore, the overexpressed α-syn is able to impact the protein degradation system including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy [58, 59]. The damaged protein degradation system in turn leads to more α-syn accumulation, and a vicious cycle is created. Mitochondria damage and ROS production induced by MPTP may impair the
\nprotein degradation system and accelerate the toxic aggregation of α-syn.
\nMoreover, α-syn has also been reported a prion-like spread between cells and the cell-to-cell transmission of pathological α-syn may cause more aggregation of α-syn and neuronal degeneration [60–63]. The neuronal insults of mitochondria, protein degradation system and oxidative stress, together with the toxic aggregation of α-syn may increase the sensitivity of DA neurons to MPTP. And the toxic role of aberrant α-syn in neurons as well as the exact mechanisms underlying the interaction with MPTP require further exploration.
\n
\nMany in vitro studies have shown that α-syn overexpression enhances cell death following MPP+ exposure, and some have reported a resistant effect to MPTP in α-syn null mouse models [64]. These studies support the notion that the overexpression of α-syn is involved in an increased vulnerability of DA neurons to MPTP. However, Rathke’s research in transgenic mice overexpressing mutant α-syn A30P has failed to show heightened susceptibility to MPTP [65]. The motor phenotype and pathological impairments are different between transgenic and rAAV generated α-syn mouse models in many studies. It is probable that adaptive changes of DA neurons in response to α-syn overexpression prevent heightened sensitivity to MPTP in transgenic models. However, mice generated by rAAV mediated overexpression of the α-syn A53T mutant have also failed to show increased sensitivity to MPTP [66]. The overexpression of the α-syn A53T mutant did not produce loss of DA neuron and striatal fiber before MPTP treatment in their study, while modest impairments appeared in our α-syn overexpressing mice. It’s possible that the expression levels and pathological stages induced by α-syn influence the vulnerability to MPTP. Due to the variable effects caused by the overexpression of α-syn, the characteristics of neurons with increased sensitivity to MPTP require further clarification.
\n
\nIn conclusion, we used rAAV2/1- α-syn vectors to generate progressive nigrostriatal pathology and motor behavior deficits, the lesions mimicked primary features observed in PD patients. Furthermore, we also investigated the influence of neurotoxin MPTP after rAAV vectors mediated overexpression of α-syn, and the results suggested increased vulnerability of mice to MPTP. These models extend the role of overexpressed α-syn in the nigrostriatal system under conditions of environmental insults, and simultaneously provide effective approaches for exploring the pathologic mechanisms of PD and the development of related therapies.

  10:`# Alterations of mitochondrial dynamics allow retrograde propagation of locally initiated axonal insults

\n### In chronic neurodegenerative syndromes, neurons progressively die through a generalized retraction pattern triggering retrograde axonal degeneration toward the cell bodies, which molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Recent observations suggest that direct activation of pro-apoptotic signaling in axons triggers local degenerative events associated with early alteration of axonal mitochondrial dynamics. This raises the question of the role of mitochondrial dynamics on both axonal vulnerability stress and their implication in the spreading of damages toward unchallenged parts of the neuron. Here, using micro uidic chambers, we assessed the consequences of interfering with OPA1 and DRP1 proteins
\n
\nAxonal and synaptic degeneration are key processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons degenerate through a protracted Dying-Back pattern, sequentially it involves collapse of synaptic ends, dismantling of axonal tracts and, ultimately, degeneration of the cell body1. While the mechanisms involved in neuronal soma destruction have been extensively studied, the molecular cues leading to axonal degeneration remain elusive. Seminal studies on Wallerian Degeneration and Wallerian Degeneration Slow (WLD(s)) spontaneous mutant mice, have sug- gested that axons and somas degenerate through distinct mechanisms2. Indeed, upon axotomy, while retrograde degeneration of the axons towards the cell body entails apoptotic signaling, the destruction of the distal part of axons implicates an orchestrated process involving important modi cations of NAD+-associated signaling pathways3. Once proposed to be mediated through nuclear production of NAD+ 4, increasing evidence indi- cates that cytoplasmic or even mitochondrial production of NAD+ mediates a strong axo-protective e ect5,6. Consistent with these notions, axonal transport conveys NAD+ producing enzymes to the distal part of the axons7,8. Moreover, axotomy, peripheral microtubule destabilization or apoptosis signaling have all been shown to trigger axonal NAD+ depletion associated with mitochondrial transport impairment and mitochondrial dysfunc- tions such as mitochondrial transition Pore (mPTP) opening in axonal endings9. We and others have shown that NAD+ cross talks with local apoptotic pathways and apoptosome in axons10,11, partially through mitochondrial SirT3 activation12,13.  is is in line with evidence showing that e ectors of the pro-apoptotic modules control degenerative processes in axons triggered during the neurodevelopmental phase14–16 a period associated with extreme vulnerability of neurons toward apoptosis17,18 and that the modality of apoptotic modules activation is itself compartmentalized19.  erefore, several lines of evidence point toward axonal mitochondria playing a cru- cial role in gate-keeping axonal vulnerability toward stressors which involve subtle adjustments of mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial dynamics and quality control regulate these functions, including local energy supply and sequestration of pro-apoptotic factors.
\n
\nMitochondria are complex versatile organelles, forming networks that are constantly remodeled through signi cant fusion and  ssion events, which are tightly controlled by several key proteins with GTPase activity. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) manages  ssion while Mitofusins (MFN1, MFN2) and OPA1 handle fusion of mitochondria20–23.  is dynamics is greatly modi ed during apoptosis, and  ssion of the mitochondrial net- work is considered an early event of apoptosis24–26. Consequently, several studies have shown that an increase of mitochondrial  ssion, through DRP1 overexpression or by Mitofusins and/or OPA1 inhibition, enhances cell vulnerability toward apoptosis, or sensitizes cells to stress24,27–29, particularly neurons30,31. Moreover, MFN2 is necessary for axonal mitochondrial transport and positioning32,33, and alteration of mitochondrial  ssion through DRP1 inactivation or OPA1 inactivation leads to abnormal mitochondria positioning in neurites34,35. Alteration of mitochondrial dynamics has been associated to the early stage of neurodegenerative conditions20,36,37; and inhibiting DRP1 proved to be a promising strategy in order to delay neuronal demise31,38. However, the exact role of mitochondrial dynamics in axonal susceptibility and/or resistance to direct focalized insults remains a poorly documented question. While inhibition of MFN2 was reported to lead to spontaneous axonal degeneration in peripheral neurons33, direct axonal insults such as abnormal calcium in ux, or pro in ammatory conditions were shown to trigger local mitochondrial and axonal alteration in vitro30. Importantly, these alterations were demonstrated to be reversible39. While this suggests that the spread of mitochondrial alteration may be bu ered by unchallenged parts of the axons, the question remains whether damaged fragmented mitochondria can convey dysfunction/pro-apoptotic signals to distant, unchallenged areas of the neuron.
\n
\nHere, we aim to study the consequences of mitochondrial dynamics alteration on axonal vulnerability to axonal pro-apoptotic stress. Using primary neurons in compartmented culture devices, we applied rotenone, a mitochondrial stressor, on the distal parts of axons. We evaluated the in uence of mitochondrial dynamics alter- ations on axonal vulnerability through pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial  ssion with Mdivi-1, as well as overexpression of wild type or mutant DRP1 or OPA1 proteins. Finally, this paradigm allowed us to analyze the impact of mitochondrial  ssion on the retrograde spreading of apoptotic signals along axons.
\n
\n## Results
\n
\n### Genetic manipulation of mitochondrial dynamics does not trigger spontaneous axonal degeneration.
\n
\nMitochondrial  ssion is an early event preceding axonal tubulin dismantlement a er either somatic or axonal insults. In previous studies we showed that axo-protective molecules impaired both mitochondrial  ssion and axonal degeneration processes13,40. Here, in order to assess whether  ssion could be a cause or a con- sequence of ongoing axonal degeneration, we investigated the direct role of mitochondrial dynamics on spon- taneous axonal degeneration. We used a previously developed model of Cerebellar Granule Neurons (CGN) grown in micro uidic chambers which allowed the compartmentalization of axons and somas in two separate chambers. Because mitochondrial fragmentation can be a result an impaired fusion and/or an increase in  ssion, we used genetic manipulation of two key proteins that control mitochondrial dynamics: (1) the profusion protein OPA1 and (2) the pro- ssion protein DRP1. Prior to seeding in the micro uidic devices, CGN neurons were electroporated with constructs encoding either wild type OPA1, or OPA1G330E, a dominant negative mutant of OPA141, or wild type DRP1. Co-transfection with the MitoDsRed expression vector allowed for direct visuali- zation of mitochondrial morphology35. Quantitative analysis of axonal mitochondrial morphology 10 days a er transfection showed that in control condition, small  ssionned mitochondria (≤2 μm long), represented approx- imately 40% of the mitochondrial population, while the remaining ≈60% consisted of  lamentous (2–4 μm) and hyper- lamentous (≥4 μm) mitochondria (Fig. 1a,d). Overexpression of OPA1 did not modify these per- centages to statistical signi cance, although slightly displacing the repartition toward longer forms. As expected, forcing  ssion by inactivation of OPA1 through overexpression of OPA1G300E or by overexpression of the pro- s- sion protein DRP1 led to a dramatic increase in fragmented mitochondria that accounted for almost 70% of the total mitochondria (Fig. 1a,d).  e impact of these mitochondrial dynamics modulations on mitochondrial mobility was then studied through kymograph analysis (Fig. 1b). In the control condition, approximately 80% of mitochondria are immobile and approximately 30% have anterograde or retrograde mobility with an average speed of 0.1μm.s−1 (Fig. 1e,f). Neither OPA1G300E nor DRP1 overexpression did modify the percentage of motile mitochondria or the average speed of mitochondria (Fig. 1e,f). Accordingly, the repartition of fragmented mito- chondria in OPA1G300E or DRP1 conditions was homogeneous in both the somato-dendritic compartment and axonal endings of CGN, and no major change was observed as compared to the control neurons (data not shown). To test whether altered fragmented mitochondria could be engaged in the apoptotic pathway, the distribution of cytochrome c was compared to MitoDsRed, allowing detection of potentially deleterious cytochrome c leaks from mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 1a,g, the MitoDsRed and cytochrome c signals were co-localized, even in fragmented mitochondria following OPA1G300E or DRP1 overexpression, thus indicating that mitochondria were not engaged in a pro-apoptotic process. Furthermore, analysis of CGN morphology showed that none of the conditions impacted neuronal survival as assessed by nuclear condensation in the somatic chamber and axonal beta3-tubulin staining (Fig. 1c,h). In conclusion, our data show that increasing mitochondrial  ssion through overexpression of OPA1G300E or DRP1, results in an increase to 80% of fragmented mitochondria in both soma- to-dendritic and axonal compartments, as compared to 40% in control conditions. However this did not signi - cantly impact axonal fate nor lead to spontaneous activation of apoptotic pathways in CGN.
\n
\n### Local pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial  ssion prevented axonal damage.
\n
\nWhile increasing mitochondrial  ssion per se did not lead to spontaneous axonal degeneration, mitochondrial  ssion could sensitize axons toward stressors such as rotenone.  is mitochondrial poison promotes neuronal apop- tosis and primarily targets the Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, triggers mitochondrial ROS production. Due to micro uidic barriers and axons occluding the micro channels, molecular di usion between axonal and somatic chambers is highly limited42,43. Using this to our advantage, we tested whether mitochondrial  ssion modi es the vulnerability of axons toward susceptibility to pro apoptotic stressor. Rotenone was selectively applied to CGN axonal compartments in order to initiate local degenerative events. Axonal application of up to 5 μM of rotenone in High Glucose (HG) condition had no visible e ect on both axonal mitochondrial mor- phology and axonal degeneration (Fig. 2a–d,m,n).
\n
\nHowever, as previously observed13, in glycolytically impaired conditions (i.e. in Low Glucose (LG) conditions), rotenone induced extensive axonal mitochondrial  ssion and axonal degeneration (Fig. 2e–h,m,n). A striking observation was that while rotenone treatment of axonal endings in glycolytically impaired conditions triggers complete axonal degeneration in the distal (treated) chambers, there is almost no observable retrograde spreading of the axonal damage toward the cell body, as assessed by nuclear integrity staining a er 24 hours (Fig. 2g). Yet, careful examination and morphological analysis of GFP-transfected at a later time point (axons treated for 48 hours) showed evidence of a slow and partial retrograde degeneration (Sup Fig. 1).
\n
\nWe then evaluated the efficiency of pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial fission in impeding rotenone-induced axonal degeneration. While application of SP600125, a JNK inhibitor showed no protec- tive e ect (Fig. 2n,k–l,m), application of Mdivi-1, an inhibitor of DRP144,45, in the axonal chamber prevented both mitochondrial fragmentation and axonal degeneration induced by rotenone in LG medium (Fig. 2n,i,j,m). Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that preventing mitochondrial alteration at the DRP1 level is su cient to prevent rotenone-induced axonal degeneration.
\n
\n### Increasing  ssion enhanced axonal vulnerability to rotenone and restricts retrograde spreading toward the cell body.
\n
\nAlteration of mitochondrial dynamics by genetic means may lead to subtle axonal alterations in mitochondrial physiology, which although non-lethal per se, have been proposed to sensitize cells to further stress28,41. In order to assess whether fragmented axonal mitochondria are associated with increased vulnerability to axonal rotenone, we exposed the axons of OPA1-, OPA1G300E- and DRP1-transfected neurons to 5 μM rotenone in HG cell culture medium, a sub-threshold condition in which rotenone has no deleterious e ect. As shown in Fig. 3a–d,q, in HG medium, the expression of control and Mito-DsRed vectors, alone or in combination with rotenone (5 μM) axonal application, had no e ect on mitochondrial morphology or axonal integrity. Overexpression of OPA1 did not modify axonal integrity or the overall mitochondrial morphology with or without rotenone (Fig. 3e–h). However, application of rotenone in HG medium of both OPA1G300E (Fig. 3i–l) and DRP1 (Fig. 3m–p) treated axons resulted in 30% axonal fragmentation a er a 24 h treatment (Fig. 3q). It can be concluded that mitochondrial  ssion signi cantly enhances axonal vulnerability to rotenone and allows to overcome the inhibitory e ect of high glycolytic environment. Interestingly, at time points where axons show no sign of degeneration (6h), rotenone treatment of axonal segment triggered a decrease in both mitochondria movement (from 33% to 12% ) and speed (0.95 to 0.04 μm/s−1).  is e ect was even more pronounced under DRP1 overexpression condition where mitochondria virtually halted in the treated segments (motility drops from 30% to 1.8% and speed from 0.05 to 0.015 μm/s−1).
\n
\nAs described in Fig. 2, axonal application of rotenone triggers destruction of the treated axonal endings asso- ciated with a minor and very slow retrograde degeneration pro le inside the micro-channel area. A plausible scenario would be that mitochondria lying in the unchallenged parts of the axons may act as bu er, limiting the retrograde spread of locally imitated insults. In order to assess whether mitochondrial  ssion may modify retrograde degeneration, together with OPA1G300E or DRP1 plasmids CGN neurons were co-transfected with a GFP encoding vector allowing visualization of the complete neuronal morphology. DIV10 GCN, grown in HG conditions, were treated with rotenone applied on the axonal chamber. Morphological integrity of both distal and proximal parts of the axons individualized in the micro-channels was then recorded. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, under these high glucose culture conditions, rotenone treatment did not result in a signi cant axonal degeneration in control CGN, with very few fragmentation events observed only inside the distal part of the micro-channels. Strikingly, axons from neurons transfected with OPA1G300E (Fig. 4c,d) and DRP1 (Fig. 4e,f) and treated with rote- none, show extensive signs of degeneration in the distal parts of the micro-channel. In DRP1-overexpressing neu- rons, and to a lesser extent for OPA1G300E expressing neurons, this is associated with further signs of retrograde degeneration toward the proximal part of the micro-channels (Fig. 4c–f) and somatic degeneration in the somatic chamber (not shown). Quanti cation of the axonal degeneration index in the micro-channels clearly indicates that both DRP1 and OPA1G300E promote a fast retrograde degeneration process (Fig. 4g,h).
\n
\nOverall, these results showed that modi cation of mitochondrial dynamics through either impairment of mitochondrial fusion (OPA1G300E) or promotion of mitochondrial  ssion (DRP1) dramatically increased axonal vulnerability toward exogenous stress, suggesting that mitochondrial dynamics is a key player in controlling dif- fusion of deleterious signals in neuronal axonal cytoplasm towards the cell body.
\n
\n## Discussion
\n
\nIncreasing research shows that mitochondrial dynamics, which controls mitochondrial morphology and func- tions, plays a crucial part in the regulation of cellular processes ranging from bioenergetics control to apoptosis related degeneration20–23. As such, mitochondrial functions and dysfunctions are key processes in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.  e impairment of mitochondrial transport, respiration and dynamics, have all been shown to be early events in neuronal dysfunction46. However, since more than 90% of the neuronal cyto- plasm is located in neuronal extensions that extend far from the cell body, focal neurotoxic aggressions (protein aggregates, stroke...) a ecting only a portion of neuronal cytoplasm could potentially initiate local degenera- tive events.  erefore, local control of mitochondrial functions likely plays an important role in gate keeping early events in neuronal degeneration. However, its exact role in the Dying Back retraction process and axonal degeneration remains poorly documented1. Cumulatively, our results show that mitochondrial  ssion is an early and crucial event in axonal degeneration triggered by axonal rotenone application, which only occurs upon local and concomitant glycolytic impairment.  us, this suggests that unchallenged axons have high axo-protective endogenous signaling capabilities. Arti cially forcing mitochondrial dynamics toward fragmentation by impair- ing fusion or activating  ssion greatly increases axonal vulnerability toward exogenous stressors like rotenone by itself. Strikingly, increase in mitochondrial  ssion is also associated with the retrograde spreading of degeneration toward axonal proximal parts. Our results thus suggest that mitochondrial dynamics tightly controls both axonal vulnerability under local stress and the spreading of deleterious signals toward neuronal cell bodies.
\n
\nInitial works on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in apoptotic processes led to propose a model where shi ing its balance towards fusion drives cell resistance to stress whereas cell vulnerability is observed if the bal- ance is shi ed towards  ssion24,27,29,47. Surprisingly, in our experimental conditions overexpression of wtOPA1 had no signi cant consequences on CGN mitochondrial morphology.  is may be linked to the fact that CGN already have highly elongated mitochondrial networks when compared to cortical neurons in basal condition. Inactivating fusion or activating  ssion, through overexpression of OPA1G300E or DRP1 respectively, led to mito- chondrial fragmentation without spontaneous apoptosis and axonal degeneration.  is is in line with data show- ing that inducing fragmentation through DRP1 or OPA1 pathways does not systematically promote spontaneous cellular death, a process that depends both on the cell type and cellular stress27,28,35,47.  e deleterious e ects of mitochondrial complex-I inhibitory molecules were previously shown to be inhibited by high glycolytic envi- ronments13,48–51. Interestingly, our results show that inducing fragmentation through DRP1 activation or OPA1 inactivation leads to axonal degeneration under these protective conditions and may thus indicate that mito- chondrial  ssion in axons reproduces the supplemental stress provided by glycolytic impairment in presence of rotenone.  is indeed suggests that the alteration of mitochondrial dynamics and glycolytic impairment may have overlapping consequences resulting in axonal degeneration. It is noteworthy that although OPA1 and DRP1 have di erent functions, their opposing modulation leading to increased mitochondrial fragmentation with sim- ilar consequences on axonal sensitization to apoptosis. Within the mitochondria, OPA1 inactivation destabilizes cristae junctions leading to inner membrane space mobilization of cytochrome c as a bona  de preparation for apoptosis52–55. DRP1 has also been proposed to play a role in cristae remodeling and could participate in the execution of apoptosis56. In addition to a direct impact on apoptosis, the consequences of mitochondrial frag- mentation can modify ROS levels57,58 and/or Ca2+ bu ering capacities59 together with alterations in energetic states60,61. Short, fragmented mitochondria may favor an uncoupled state and/or maximal respiration and/or increased protons conductance, leading to a decreased ATP production62. Interestingly, while a local decrease in ATP could a ect microtubule stability63, this was recently shown to lead to axonal fragmentation through a mitochondrial Sirt3 pathway, an enzyme that mitigates rotenone-induced axonal degeneration, as we and others have previously demonstrated12,13.
\n
\nIn neurons, several studies reported that early mitochondrial  ssion is triggered by neurodegenerative con- ditions36,64 and is linked to an enhanced vulnerability toward apoptosis. In our experimental paradigm of axonal degeneration, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial  ssion by Mdivi-1, which is described to inhibit direct apoptotic signaling through mitochondrial  ssion and cytochrome c release caused by BAX signaliza- tion44,45, protects axons from the deleterious e ects of rotenone.  is suggests that DRP1 is primarily involved in the early phase of axonal degeneration. While retrograde propagation of axonally initiated insults, coined as the “Dying Back” process, is a common event in neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanisms underlying such ret- rograde events have been poorly studied in mature CNS neurons. Apoptosis being considered as an autocatalytic event, one could therefore postulate that local activation of pro-apoptotic signaling in axons may lead to a fast retrograde spreading toward the cell body. A surprising observation was that upon axonal rotenone insults in low glucose conditions, although the treated axonal segments degenerate through a caspase-dependent pathway13, no signi cant retrograde spreading toward the cell body was evidenced in basal conditions. Interestingly, while our previous observations suggested that axons have high intrinsic resistance toward direct apoptosis activation13,65, a recent report showed that direct axonal apoptotic degeneration is gated by a somatic apoptotic signaling19. Collectively these  ndings support the notion that unchallenged parts of the neurons may bu er the spreading of toxic signals in the cytoplasm as previously hypothesized66 and suggested by experimental results showing that locally induced mitochondrial damages in vivo are due to a local and reversible process39. Our results show that pushing mitochondrial dynamics toward fragmentation through an increase of DRP1 activity and, to a lesser extent, by a diminution of OPA1 activity, signi cantly modi es the spatial degeneration pro le triggered by axonal application of rotenone under protective glucose conditions.  is therefore experimentally indicates, for the  rst time, that mitochondrial dynamics is a critical process that allows bu ering pathological signal spreading in axons.
\n
\nThis further raises the fundamental question of the spatial spreading of pro-apoptotic signaling modules in the cytoplasm. Some studies have evidenced that, upon apoptosis in cell lines, cytochrome c release from mitochon- dria occurs through spatial waves in the cytoplasm67 thus suggesting that apoptosis may occur as an orchestrated spatial pattern. Interestingly, spatial propagation events of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in cell lines, have been recently shown to be promoted by the dispersion of free radicals leading to the opening of the transition pore68. While spreading of degenerative signal may be caused by damaged mitochondria moving to unchallenged, our results showing that rotenone induces a dramatic slowdown of mitochondrial movement and speed are not in favor of that scenario. Interestingly, theoretical studies have shown that spreading of apoptosis signals may occur through di usion of locally-activated executive apoptotic proteins69,70. Although not address- ing directly these speci c questions, our data suggest that mitochondrial integrity is crucial in the axonal di usion of executive apoptotic factors, as  ssionned mitochondria lose their capacity to prevent retrograde propagation of apoptotic factors in axons in the case of intercurrent stress.
\n
\nAltogether, our data highlight the essential role of mitochondrial dynamics in axonal apoptosis signal ampli-  cation. Our results showing that either OPA1 inactivation or DRP1 overexpression is su cient to overcome speci c axonal resistance toward apoptosis by sensitizing mitochondria to sub-threshold rotenone, suggest that mitochondrial priming e ect in axons is a key process of axonal degeneration. In the neurodegenerative diseases context where neuronal degeneration can be due to many converging causes71, our results could indicate that circumstances inducing mitochondria fragmentation are not su cient to cause neuronal degeneration. However, reminiscent of progressive ageing process, intercurrent and cumulative events such as protein aggregation, muta- tion, loss of synaptic signalization could hasten neuronal death and initiate spatial dispersion of locally induced degenerative events.

\n## Methods
\n
\n### Micro uidic Chip Production.
\n
\nMicro uidic chips are made up of two elements: 55 mm-high macro-cham- bers for cell or  uid injection, separated by narrowing arrays of 3 mm-high micro-channels allowing directional axonal outgrowth.  e two-compartmented chips were constructed as previously described. Brie y, micro uidic positives masters were produced trough spin coating and UV insulation of SU-8 photolithographic resin on silicon wafers.
\n
\nPolydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184, PDMS, Dow Corning) was mixed with a curing agent (9:1 ratio) and degassed under vacuum.  e resulting preparation was poured on micro uidic masters and reticulated at 70 °C for 2 hours.  e elastomeric polymer print was detached and two reservoirs were punched manually for each macro-channel.  e resulting piece was cleaned with isopropanol and dried.  e polymer print and a glass cover slip were treated for 200 seconds in an air plasma generator (100% power, 0.6mBar, Diener Electronic) and bonded together.  e chips were placed under UV for 20 minutes and then coated with a solution of poly-D-lysine (10 μg/mL, Sigma) overnight and washed with PBS before cell seeding.
\n
\n### Primary Neuronal Cultures.
\n
\nPostnatal P5 Swiss mice were purchased from René Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle, France) and cared for by the animal care facility at University Pierre et Marie Curie (IFR83). Animal care was conducted in accordance with standard ethical guidelines (U.S. National Institutes of Health publication no. 85–24, revised 1985, and European Committee Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and the local, IBPS and UPMC, ethics committee approved the experiments. Mouse pups were decapitated and cerebella were micro-dissected. All steps of dissection were conducted in ice cold phosphate bu er saline w/o calcium and Magnesium (DPBS) and supplemented with 0.1% glucose (Life Technologies). Dissected structures were digested with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) for 10 minutes at 37 °C. A er tryspin inactivation with Heat Inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA), structures were mechanically dissociated in DMEM glutamax (Life Technologies) with plastic pipettes in presence of 104 U/mL DNAse (Sigma Aldrich). A er several rinses, cells were re-suspended in DMEM, to a  nal density of 45 million cells/mL. Cells were then seeded in the somatic compartment by introducing 1.7 μL of the cell suspension into the upper reservoir. Cells  owed into the chamber and adhered within 1–2 minutes. Cell culture medium was then added to the four reservoirs (60 μL/reservoir). Neurons were grown in High Glucose (25 mM) DMEM glutamax containing sodium pyruvate supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin ( ermo sher, Gibco), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), N2 and B27 without antioxidant neuronal supplements (Life Technologies). Micro uidic chips were placed in plastic Petri dishes containing H2O to prevent evaporation and incubated at 37 °C in a humid 5% C02 atmosphere.  e culture medium was renewed six days a er seeding. Upon di erentiation, 2 or 3 days a er seeding, CGN axons entered the micro-channels and reached the second chamber a er 5 to 6 days.
\n
\n### Primary Neurons transfection.
\n
\nOPA1, OPA1G300E or DRP1, and Mito-DsRed plasmids were co-transfected using electroporation according to manufacturer’s recommendation (Microporator, Invitrogen). Brie y, a er cell dissociation, cells were washed in PBS centrifuged at low speed. Neurons were re-suspended in electroporation bu er (120 μL for 3 million of cells, Invitrogen) containing 15 μg of plasmids constructs. For co-transfection, a ratio of 2/3 for OPA-1 or DRP-1 plasmids and 1/3 for Mito-DsRed plasmid was used.  e electroporator settings were 1350 Volt with 30mseconds for 1 pulse. A er the pulse, cells were re-suspended in recovery medium (900 μL of DMEM with 100 μL of FBS). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 minutes, and were further re-suspended in complete medium and seeded as described above. A transfection e ciency of 40–60% was routinely obtained with a >90% co-transfection e ciency.
\n
\n### Pharmacological Treatment.
\n
\nAll chemicals were prepared as concentrated solutions according to the rec- ommendations of the di erent manufacturers. Compounds were aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes and used once, to avoid repeated freezing/thawing processes. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C for no longer than two months. Care was taken to protect photosensitive molecules from light by wrapping the test tubes in aluminum foil. Drugs were extemporaneously diluted at their respective  nal concentration in DMEM containing 10% FBS+ N2+ B27 minus Anti-Oxidant (AO). In order to study the impact of Glucose on rotenone induced toxicity, two dis- tinct DMEM formulations di ering only in their glucose concentration were used. HG conditions correspond to DMEM, high glucose, Glutamax Supplement, Pyruvate ( ermo sher, Gibco, Cat ref 10569010) contain- ing 4.5 g.L−1 (25 mM) of glucose. LG condition corresponds to DMEM, low glucose, Glutamax Supplement, Pyruvate ( ermo sher, Gibco Cat ref 10567014) containing 1 g.L−1 (5 mM) of glucose. Ten days a er seeding, Rotenone (5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) with or without mdivi-1 (20 μM, Tocris) or SP 600125 (10 μM) diluted in LG or HG DMEM were applied for 24 or 48 h according to the treatment. A er treatment, neurons were  xed with Paraformaldehyde 4% (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes at room temperature then washed with PBS.
\n
\n### Immuno uorescence.
\n
\nCells were washed twice with D-PBS for 5 minutes and permeabilized for 30 minutes with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS. Primary antibodies PBS solutions were then added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. A er, two PBS rinses, cells were further incubated with solutions of the corresponding sec- ondary antibodies for two hours at room temperature.  e chips were then rinsed once with PBS and mounted in Mowiol-based medium.  e following primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: alpha-tubulin-FITC (Sigma); Microtubule Associated Protein -2 (Sigma; MAP-2, mouse or rabbit monoclonal (1/500); beta3-tubulin (Sigma; mouse monoclonal 1/500); cytochrome c (Cell Signaling 1/300). Species-speci c secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 350, 488, or 555 were used (1/500, Life Technologies,) to visualize bound primary antibodies.
\n
\nImage Acquisition. Images were acquired with an Axio-observer Z1 (Zeiss)  tted with a cooled CCD camera (CoolsnapHQ2, Ropert Scientific).  e microscope was controlled with Metamorph so ware (Molecular Imaging) and images were analyzed using ImageJ so ware (ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).
\n
\n### Quantification of axonal degeneration and neuronal survival.
\n
\nAxonal degeneration was assessed through beta3-tubulin staining as previously described in ref. 13. Briefly, while beta3-tubulin immunostaining was continuous and homogenous in healthy axons, it appeared punctiform in fragmented axons.  e percentage of fragmented axons was calculated by computing the area ratio of circular fragmented axons segments over the total area of axons (six images per axonal chamber). For each condition, cell survival was estimated in the somatic chamber by calculating the percentage of condensed nuclei a er Hoechst labeling. Reported values are means of at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Retrograde axonal degeneration was assessed on CGN co-transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFPN1 (Clontech) and plasmids encoding Empty, OPA1G300E or DRP1. Ten days a er electroporation, axonal endings were challenged with 5 μM rotenone for 18 hours. Overlapping images were capture on live neurons, in order to recreate a mosaic image encompassing the somatic, micro-channel and distal areas. Axonal degeneration was assessed by computing the fragmentation index in 2 contiguous micro-channel areas, namely proximal ( first half of the micro-channel) and distal (second half of the microchannel).
\n
\n###Mitochondrial morphology analysis and mitochondria speed analysis.
\n
\nMitochondrial morphol- ogy was assessed from cytochrome c or TOM20  uorescent immunostaining or transfected Mito-DsRed  uo- rescent signal. Images were acquired using 63X and mitochondrial morphological analysis was performed with Image J. Based on length, mitochondria were grouped in three classes: spherical mitochondria or mitochondria with a size under or equal at 2 μm,  lamentous mitochondria between 2 and 4 μm and hyper- lamentous above 4 μm. Mitochondria speed analysis was carried out by video-microscopy with an incubation chamber at 37 °C. We captured 10 minute movies with 12 frames per minute using a 63X oil-objective.  en kymographs are extracted with Image J (plugin Kymograph) and the mitochondria speed is calculated with the kymograph slope.
\n
\n### Statistical Analysis.
\n
\nDifferences were monitored by 1 way ANOVA and a two way ANOVA for mito- chondrial size (Fig. 2c), followed by a post-hoc Bonferoni test. For all analyses: *p-value, 0.05; **p-value, 0.01; ***p-value, 0.001.

\n### In chronic neurodegenerative syndromes, neurons progressively die through a generalized retraction pattern triggering retrograde axonal degeneration toward the cell bodies, which molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Recent observations suggest that direct activation of pro-apoptotic signaling in axons triggers local degenerative events associated with early alteration of axonal mitochondrial dynamics. This raises the question of the role of mitochondrial dynamics on both axonal vulnerability stress and their implication in the spreading of damages toward unchallenged parts of the neuron. Here, using micro uidic chambers, we assessed the consequences of interfering with OPA1 and DRP1 proteins
\n
\nAxonal and synaptic degeneration are key processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons degenerate through a protracted Dying-Back pattern, sequentially it involves collapse of synaptic ends, dismantling of axonal tracts and, ultimately, degeneration of the cell body1. While the mechanisms involved in neuronal soma destruction have been extensively studied, the molecular cues leading to axonal degeneration remain elusive. Seminal studies on Wallerian Degeneration and Wallerian Degeneration Slow (WLD(s)) spontaneous mutant mice, have sug- gested that axons and somas degenerate through distinct mechanisms2. Indeed, upon axotomy, while retrograde degeneration of the axons towards the cell body entails apoptotic signaling, the destruction of the distal part of axons implicates an orchestrated process involving important modi cations of NAD+-associated signaling pathways3. Once proposed to be mediated through nuclear production of NAD+ 4, increasing evidence indi- cates that cytoplasmic or even mitochondrial production of NAD+ mediates a strong axo-protective e ect5,6. Consistent with these notions, axonal transport conveys NAD+ producing enzymes to the distal part of the axons7,8. Moreover, axotomy, peripheral microtubule destabilization or apoptosis signaling have all been shown to trigger axonal NAD+ depletion associated with mitochondrial transport impairment and mitochondrial dysfunc- tions such as mitochondrial transition Pore (mPTP) opening in axonal endings9. We and others have shown that NAD+ cross talks with local apoptotic pathways and apoptosome in axons10,11, partially through mitochondrial SirT3 activation12,13.  is is in line with evidence showing that e ectors of the pro-apoptotic modules control degenerative processes in axons triggered during the neurodevelopmental phase14–16 a period associated with extreme vulnerability of neurons toward apoptosis17,18 and that the modality of apoptotic modules activation is itself compartmentalized19.  erefore, several lines of evidence point toward axonal mitochondria playing a cru- cial role in gate-keeping axonal vulnerability toward stressors which involve subtle adjustments of mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial dynamics and quality control regulate these functions, including local energy supply and sequestration of pro-apoptotic factors.
\n
\nMitochondria are complex versatile organelles, forming networks that are constantly remodeled through signi cant fusion and  ssion events, which are tightly controlled by several key proteins with GTPase activity. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) manages  ssion while Mitofusins (MFN1, MFN2) and OPA1 handle fusion of mitochondria20–23.  is dynamics is greatly modi ed during apoptosis, and  ssion of the mitochondrial net- work is considered an early event of apoptosis24–26. Consequently, several studies have shown that an increase of mitochondrial  ssion, through DRP1 overexpression or by Mitofusins and/or OPA1 inhibition, enhances cell vulnerability toward apoptosis, or sensitizes cells to stress24,27–29, particularly neurons30,31. Moreover, MFN2 is necessary for axonal mitochondrial transport and positioning32,33, and alteration of mitochondrial  ssion through DRP1 inactivation or OPA1 inactivation leads to abnormal mitochondria positioning in neurites34,35. Alteration of mitochondrial dynamics has been associated to the early stage of neurodegenerative conditions20,36,37; and inhibiting DRP1 proved to be a promising strategy in order to delay neuronal demise31,38. However, the exact role of mitochondrial dynamics in axonal susceptibility and/or resistance to direct focalized insults remains a poorly documented question. While inhibition of MFN2 was reported to lead to spontaneous axonal degeneration in peripheral neurons33, direct axonal insults such as abnormal calcium in ux, or pro in ammatory conditions were shown to trigger local mitochondrial and axonal alteration in vitro30. Importantly, these alterations were demonstrated to be reversible39. While this suggests that the spread of mitochondrial alteration may be bu ered by unchallenged parts of the axons, the question remains whether damaged fragmented mitochondria can convey dysfunction/pro-apoptotic signals to distant, unchallenged areas of the neuron.
\n
\nHere, we aim to study the consequences of mitochondrial dynamics alteration on axonal vulnerability to axonal pro-apoptotic stress. Using primary neurons in compartmented culture devices, we applied rotenone, a mitochondrial stressor, on the distal parts of axons. We evaluated the in uence of mitochondrial dynamics alter- ations on axonal vulnerability through pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial  ssion with Mdivi-1, as well as overexpression of wild type or mutant DRP1 or OPA1 proteins. Finally, this paradigm allowed us to analyze the impact of mitochondrial  ssion on the retrograde spreading of apoptotic signals along axons.
\n
\n## Results
\n
\n### Genetic manipulation of mitochondrial dynamics does not trigger spontaneous axonal degeneration.
\n
\nMitochondrial  ssion is an early event preceding axonal tubulin dismantlement a er either somatic or axonal insults. In previous studies we showed that axo-protective molecules impaired both mitochondrial  ssion and axonal degeneration processes13,40. Here, in order to assess whether  ssion could be a cause or a con- sequence of ongoing axonal degeneration, we investigated the direct role of mitochondrial dynamics on spon- taneous axonal degeneration. We used a previously developed model of Cerebellar Granule Neurons (CGN) grown in micro uidic chambers which allowed the compartmentalization of axons and somas in two separate chambers. Because mitochondrial fragmentation can be a result an impaired fusion and/or an increase in  ssion, we used genetic manipulation of two key proteins that control mitochondrial dynamics: (1) the profusion protein OPA1 and (2) the pro- ssion protein DRP1. Prior to seeding in the micro uidic devices, CGN neurons were electroporated with constructs encoding either wild type OPA1, or OPA1G330E, a dominant negative mutant of OPA141, or wild type DRP1. Co-transfection with the MitoDsRed expression vector allowed for direct visuali- zation of mitochondrial morphology35. Quantitative analysis of axonal mitochondrial morphology 10 days a er transfection showed that in control condition, small  ssionned mitochondria (≤2 μm long), represented approx- imately 40% of the mitochondrial population, while the remaining ≈60% consisted of  lamentous (2–4 μm) and hyper- lamentous (≥4 μm) mitochondria (Fig. 1a,d). Overexpression of OPA1 did not modify these per- centages to statistical signi cance, although slightly displacing the repartition toward longer forms. As expected, forcing  ssion by inactivation of OPA1 through overexpression of OPA1G300E or by overexpression of the pro- s- sion protein DRP1 led to a dramatic increase in fragmented mitochondria that accounted for almost 70% of the total mitochondria (Fig. 1a,d).  e impact of these mitochondrial dynamics modulations on mitochondrial mobility was then studied through kymograph analysis (Fig. 1b). In the control condition, approximately 80% of mitochondria are immobile and approximately 30% have anterograde or retrograde mobility with an average speed of 0.1μm.s−1 (Fig. 1e,f). Neither OPA1G300E nor DRP1 overexpression did modify the percentage of motile mitochondria or the average speed of mitochondria (Fig. 1e,f). Accordingly, the repartition of fragmented mito- chondria in OPA1G300E or DRP1 conditions was homogeneous in both the somato-dendritic compartment and axonal endings of CGN, and no major change was observed as compared to the control neurons (data not shown). To test whether altered fragmented mitochondria could be engaged in the apoptotic pathway, the distribution of cytochrome c was compared to MitoDsRed, allowing detection of potentially deleterious cytochrome c leaks from mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 1a,g, the MitoDsRed and cytochrome c signals were co-localized, even in fragmented mitochondria following OPA1G300E or DRP1 overexpression, thus indicating that mitochondria were not engaged in a pro-apoptotic process. Furthermore, analysis of CGN morphology showed that none of the conditions impacted neuronal survival as assessed by nuclear condensation in the somatic chamber and axonal beta3-tubulin staining (Fig. 1c,h). In conclusion, our data show that increasing mitochondrial  ssion through overexpression of OPA1G300E or DRP1, results in an increase to 80% of fragmented mitochondria in both soma- to-dendritic and axonal compartments, as compared to 40% in control conditions. However this did not signi - cantly impact axonal fate nor lead to spontaneous activation of apoptotic pathways in CGN.
\n
\n### Local pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial  ssion prevented axonal damage.
\n
\nWhile increasing mitochondrial  ssion per se did not lead to spontaneous axonal degeneration, mitochondrial  ssion could sensitize axons toward stressors such as rotenone.  is mitochondrial poison promotes neuronal apop- tosis and primarily targets the Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, triggers mitochondrial ROS production. Due to micro uidic barriers and axons occluding the micro channels, molecular di usion between axonal and somatic chambers is highly limited42,43. Using this to our advantage, we tested whether mitochondrial  ssion modi es the vulnerability of axons toward susceptibility to pro apoptotic stressor. Rotenone was selectively applied to CGN axonal compartments in order to initiate local degenerative events. Axonal application of up to 5 μM of rotenone in High Glucose (HG) condition had no visible e ect on both axonal mitochondrial mor- phology and axonal degeneration (Fig. 2a–d,m,n).
\n
\nHowever, as previously observed13, in glycolytically impaired conditions (i.e. in Low Glucose (LG) conditions), rotenone induced extensive axonal mitochondrial  ssion and axonal degeneration (Fig. 2e–h,m,n). A striking observation was that while rotenone treatment of axonal endings in glycolytically impaired conditions triggers complete axonal degeneration in the distal (treated) chambers, there is almost no observable retrograde spreading of the axonal damage toward the cell body, as assessed by nuclear integrity staining a er 24 hours (Fig. 2g). Yet, careful examination and morphological analysis of GFP-transfected at a later time point (axons treated for 48 hours) showed evidence of a slow and partial retrograde degeneration (Sup Fig. 1).
\n
\nWe then evaluated the efficiency of pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial fission in impeding rotenone-induced axonal degeneration. While application of SP600125, a JNK inhibitor showed no protec- tive e ect (Fig. 2n,k–l,m), application of Mdivi-1, an inhibitor of DRP144,45, in the axonal chamber prevented both mitochondrial fragmentation and axonal degeneration induced by rotenone in LG medium (Fig. 2n,i,j,m). Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that preventing mitochondrial alteration at the DRP1 level is su cient to prevent rotenone-induced axonal degeneration.
\n
\n### Increasing  ssion enhanced axonal vulnerability to rotenone and restricts retrograde spreading toward the cell body.
\n
\nAlteration of mitochondrial dynamics by genetic means may lead to subtle axonal alterations in mitochondrial physiology, which although non-lethal per se, have been proposed to sensitize cells to further stress28,41. In order to assess whether fragmented axonal mitochondria are associated with increased vulnerability to axonal rotenone, we exposed the axons of OPA1-, OPA1G300E- and DRP1-transfected neurons to 5 μM rotenone in HG cell culture medium, a sub-threshold condition in which rotenone has no deleterious e ect. As shown in Fig. 3a–d,q, in HG medium, the expression of control and Mito-DsRed vectors, alone or in combination with rotenone (5 μM) axonal application, had no e ect on mitochondrial morphology or axonal integrity. Overexpression of OPA1 did not modify axonal integrity or the overall mitochondrial morphology with or without rotenone (Fig. 3e–h). However, application of rotenone in HG medium of both OPA1G300E (Fig. 3i–l) and DRP1 (Fig. 3m–p) treated axons resulted in 30% axonal fragmentation a er a 24 h treatment (Fig. 3q). It can be concluded that mitochondrial  ssion signi cantly enhances axonal vulnerability to rotenone and allows to overcome the inhibitory e ect of high glycolytic environment. Interestingly, at time points where axons show no sign of degeneration (6h), rotenone treatment of axonal segment triggered a decrease in both mitochondria movement (from 33% to 12% ) and speed (0.95 to 0.04 μm/s−1).  is e ect was even more pronounced under DRP1 overexpression condition where mitochondria virtually halted in the treated segments (motility drops from 30% to 1.8% and speed from 0.05 to 0.015 μm/s−1).
\n
\nAs described in Fig. 2, axonal application of rotenone triggers destruction of the treated axonal endings asso- ciated with a minor and very slow retrograde degeneration pro le inside the micro-channel area. A plausible scenario would be that mitochondria lying in the unchallenged parts of the axons may act as bu er, limiting the retrograde spread of locally imitated insults. In order to assess whether mitochondrial  ssion may modify retrograde degeneration, together with OPA1G300E or DRP1 plasmids CGN neurons were co-transfected with a GFP encoding vector allowing visualization of the complete neuronal morphology. DIV10 GCN, grown in HG conditions, were treated with rotenone applied on the axonal chamber. Morphological integrity of both distal and proximal parts of the axons individualized in the micro-channels was then recorded. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, under these high glucose culture conditions, rotenone treatment did not result in a signi cant axonal degeneration in control CGN, with very few fragmentation events observed only inside the distal part of the micro-channels. Strikingly, axons from neurons transfected with OPA1G300E (Fig. 4c,d) and DRP1 (Fig. 4e,f) and treated with rote- none, show extensive signs of degeneration in the distal parts of the micro-channel. In DRP1-overexpressing neu- rons, and to a lesser extent for OPA1G300E expressing neurons, this is associated with further signs of retrograde degeneration toward the proximal part of the micro-channels (Fig. 4c–f) and somatic degeneration in the somatic chamber (not shown). Quanti cation of the axonal degeneration index in the micro-channels clearly indicates that both DRP1 and OPA1G300E promote a fast retrograde degeneration process (Fig. 4g,h).
\n
\nOverall, these results showed that modi cation of mitochondrial dynamics through either impairment of mitochondrial fusion (OPA1G300E) or promotion of mitochondrial  ssion (DRP1) dramatically increased axonal vulnerability toward exogenous stress, suggesting that mitochondrial dynamics is a key player in controlling dif- fusion of deleterious signals in neuronal axonal cytoplasm towards the cell body.
\n
\n## Discussion
\n
\nIncreasing research shows that mitochondrial dynamics, which controls mitochondrial morphology and func- tions, plays a crucial part in the regulation of cellular processes ranging from bioenergetics control to apoptosis related degeneration20–23. As such, mitochondrial functions and dysfunctions are key processes in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.  e impairment of mitochondrial transport, respiration and dynamics, have all been shown to be early events in neuronal dysfunction46. However, since more than 90% of the neuronal cyto- plasm is located in neuronal extensions that extend far from the cell body, focal neurotoxic aggressions (protein aggregates, stroke...) a ecting only a portion of neuronal cytoplasm could potentially initiate local degenera- tive events.  erefore, local control of mitochondrial functions likely plays an important role in gate keeping early events in neuronal degeneration. However, its exact role in the Dying Back retraction process and axonal degeneration remains poorly documented1. Cumulatively, our results show that mitochondrial  ssion is an early and crucial event in axonal degeneration triggered by axonal rotenone application, which only occurs upon local and concomitant glycolytic impairment.  us, this suggests that unchallenged axons have high axo-protective endogenous signaling capabilities. Arti cially forcing mitochondrial dynamics toward fragmentation by impair- ing fusion or activating  ssion greatly increases axonal vulnerability toward exogenous stressors like rotenone by itself. Strikingly, increase in mitochondrial  ssion is also associated with the retrograde spreading of degeneration toward axonal proximal parts. Our results thus suggest that mitochondrial dynamics tightly controls both axonal vulnerability under local stress and the spreading of deleterious signals toward neuronal cell bodies.
\n
\nInitial works on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in apoptotic processes led to propose a model where shi ing its balance towards fusion drives cell resistance to stress whereas cell vulnerability is observed if the bal- ance is shi ed towards  ssion24,27,29,47. Surprisingly, in our experimental conditions overexpression of wtOPA1 had no signi cant consequences on CGN mitochondrial morphology.  is may be linked to the fact that CGN already have highly elongated mitochondrial networks when compared to cortical neurons in basal condition. Inactivating fusion or activating  ssion, through overexpression of OPA1G300E or DRP1 respectively, led to mito- chondrial fragmentation without spontaneous apoptosis and axonal degeneration.  is is in line with data show- ing that inducing fragmentation through DRP1 or OPA1 pathways does not systematically promote spontaneous cellular death, a process that depends both on the cell type and cellular stress27,28,35,47.  e deleterious e ects of mitochondrial complex-I inhibitory molecules were previously shown to be inhibited by high glycolytic envi- ronments13,48–51. Interestingly, our results show that inducing fragmentation through DRP1 activation or OPA1 inactivation leads to axonal degeneration under these protective conditions and may thus indicate that mito- chondrial  ssion in axons reproduces the supplemental stress provided by glycolytic impairment in presence of rotenone.  is indeed suggests that the alteration of mitochondrial dynamics and glycolytic impairment may have overlapping consequences resulting in axonal degeneration. It is noteworthy that although OPA1 and DRP1 have di erent functions, their opposing modulation leading to increased mitochondrial fragmentation with sim- ilar consequences on axonal sensitization to apoptosis. Within the mitochondria, OPA1 inactivation destabilizes cristae junctions leading to inner membrane space mobilization of cytochrome c as a bona  de preparation for apoptosis52–55. DRP1 has also been proposed to play a role in cristae remodeling and could participate in the execution of apoptosis56. In addition to a direct impact on apoptosis, the consequences of mitochondrial frag- mentation can modify ROS levels57,58 and/or Ca2+ bu ering capacities59 together with alterations in energetic states60,61. Short, fragmented mitochondria may favor an uncoupled state and/or maximal respiration and/or increased protons conductance, leading to a decreased ATP production62. Interestingly, while a local decrease in ATP could a ect microtubule stability63, this was recently shown to lead to axonal fragmentation through a mitochondrial Sirt3 pathway, an enzyme that mitigates rotenone-induced axonal degeneration, as we and others have previously demonstrated12,13.
\n
\nIn neurons, several studies reported that early mitochondrial  ssion is triggered by neurodegenerative con- ditions36,64 and is linked to an enhanced vulnerability toward apoptosis. In our experimental paradigm of axonal degeneration, pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial  ssion by Mdivi-1, which is described to inhibit direct apoptotic signaling through mitochondrial  ssion and cytochrome c release caused by BAX signaliza- tion44,45, protects axons from the deleterious e ects of rotenone.  is suggests that DRP1 is primarily involved in the early phase of axonal degeneration. While retrograde propagation of axonally initiated insults, coined as the “Dying Back” process, is a common event in neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanisms underlying such ret- rograde events have been poorly studied in mature CNS neurons. Apoptosis being considered as an autocatalytic event, one could therefore postulate that local activation of pro-apoptotic signaling in axons may lead to a fast retrograde spreading toward the cell body. A surprising observation was that upon axonal rotenone insults in low glucose conditions, although the treated axonal segments degenerate through a caspase-dependent pathway13, no signi cant retrograde spreading toward the cell body was evidenced in basal conditions. Interestingly, while our previous observations suggested that axons have high intrinsic resistance toward direct apoptosis activation13,65, a recent report showed that direct axonal apoptotic degeneration is gated by a somatic apoptotic signaling19. Collectively these  ndings support the notion that unchallenged parts of the neurons may bu er the spreading of toxic signals in the cytoplasm as previously hypothesized66 and suggested by experimental results showing that locally induced mitochondrial damages in vivo are due to a local and reversible process39. Our results show that pushing mitochondrial dynamics toward fragmentation through an increase of DRP1 activity and, to a lesser extent, by a diminution of OPA1 activity, signi cantly modi es the spatial degeneration pro le triggered by axonal application of rotenone under protective glucose conditions.  is therefore experimentally indicates, for the  rst time, that mitochondrial dynamics is a critical process that allows bu ering pathological signal spreading in axons.
\n
\nThis further raises the fundamental question of the spatial spreading of pro-apoptotic signaling modules in the cytoplasm. Some studies have evidenced that, upon apoptosis in cell lines, cytochrome c release from mitochon- dria occurs through spatial waves in the cytoplasm67 thus suggesting that apoptosis may occur as an orchestrated spatial pattern. Interestingly, spatial propagation events of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in cell lines, have been recently shown to be promoted by the dispersion of free radicals leading to the opening of the transition pore68. While spreading of degenerative signal may be caused by damaged mitochondria moving to unchallenged, our results showing that rotenone induces a dramatic slowdown of mitochondrial movement and speed are not in favor of that scenario. Interestingly, theoretical studies have shown that spreading of apoptosis signals may occur through di usion of locally-activated executive apoptotic proteins69,70. Although not address- ing directly these speci c questions, our data suggest that mitochondrial integrity is crucial in the axonal di usion of executive apoptotic factors, as  ssionned mitochondria lose their capacity to prevent retrograde propagation of apoptotic factors in axons in the case of intercurrent stress.
\n
\nAltogether, our data highlight the essential role of mitochondrial dynamics in axonal apoptosis signal ampli-  cation. Our results showing that either OPA1 inactivation or DRP1 overexpression is su cient to overcome speci c axonal resistance toward apoptosis by sensitizing mitochondria to sub-threshold rotenone, suggest that mitochondrial priming e ect in axons is a key process of axonal degeneration. In the neurodegenerative diseases context where neuronal degeneration can be due to many converging causes71, our results could indicate that circumstances inducing mitochondria fragmentation are not su cient to cause neuronal degeneration. However, reminiscent of progressive ageing process, intercurrent and cumulative events such as protein aggregation, muta- tion, loss of synaptic signalization could hasten neuronal death and initiate spatial dispersion of locally induced degenerative events.

\n## Methods
\n
\n### Micro uidic Chip Production.
\n
\nMicro uidic chips are made up of two elements: 55 mm-high macro-cham- bers for cell or  uid injection, separated by narrowing arrays of 3 mm-high micro-channels allowing directional axonal outgrowth.  e two-compartmented chips were constructed as previously described. Brie y, micro uidic positives masters were produced trough spin coating and UV insulation of SU-8 photolithographic resin on silicon wafers.
\n
\nPolydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184, PDMS, Dow Corning) was mixed with a curing agent (9:1 ratio) and degassed under vacuum.  e resulting preparation was poured on micro uidic masters and reticulated at 70 °C for 2 hours.  e elastomeric polymer print was detached and two reservoirs were punched manually for each macro-channel.  e resulting piece was cleaned with isopropanol and dried.  e polymer print and a glass cover slip were treated for 200 seconds in an air plasma generator (100% power, 0.6mBar, Diener Electronic) and bonded together.  e chips were placed under UV for 20 minutes and then coated with a solution of poly-D-lysine (10 μg/mL, Sigma) overnight and washed with PBS before cell seeding.
\n
\n### Primary Neuronal Cultures.
\n
\nPostnatal P5 Swiss mice were purchased from René Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle, France) and cared for by the animal care facility at University Pierre et Marie Curie (IFR83). Animal care was conducted in accordance with standard ethical guidelines (U.S. National Institutes of Health publication no. 85–24, revised 1985, and European Committee Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and the local, IBPS and UPMC, ethics committee approved the experiments. Mouse pups were decapitated and cerebella were micro-dissected. All steps of dissection were conducted in ice cold phosphate bu er saline w/o calcium and Magnesium (DPBS) and supplemented with 0.1% glucose (Life Technologies). Dissected structures were digested with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) for 10 minutes at 37 °C. A er tryspin inactivation with Heat Inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA), structures were mechanically dissociated in DMEM glutamax (Life Technologies) with plastic pipettes in presence of 104 U/mL DNAse (Sigma Aldrich). A er several rinses, cells were re-suspended in DMEM, to a  nal density of 45 million cells/mL. Cells were then seeded in the somatic compartment by introducing 1.7 μL of the cell suspension into the upper reservoir. Cells  owed into the chamber and adhered within 1–2 minutes. Cell culture medium was then added to the four reservoirs (60 μL/reservoir). Neurons were grown in High Glucose (25 mM) DMEM glutamax containing sodium pyruvate supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin ( ermo sher, Gibco), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), N2 and B27 without antioxidant neuronal supplements (Life Technologies). Micro uidic chips were placed in plastic Petri dishes containing H2O to prevent evaporation and incubated at 37 °C in a humid 5% C02 atmosphere.  e culture medium was renewed six days a er seeding. Upon di erentiation, 2 or 3 days a er seeding, CGN axons entered the micro-channels and reached the second chamber a er 5 to 6 days.
\n
\n### Primary Neurons transfection.
\n
\nOPA1, OPA1G300E or DRP1, and Mito-DsRed plasmids were co-transfected using electroporation according to manufacturer’s recommendation (Microporator, Invitrogen). Brie y, a er cell dissociation, cells were washed in PBS centrifuged at low speed. Neurons were re-suspended in electroporation bu er (120 μL for 3 million of cells, Invitrogen) containing 15 μg of plasmids constructs. For co-transfection, a ratio of 2/3 for OPA-1 or DRP-1 plasmids and 1/3 for Mito-DsRed plasmid was used.  e electroporator settings were 1350 Volt with 30mseconds for 1 pulse. A er the pulse, cells were re-suspended in recovery medium (900 μL of DMEM with 100 μL of FBS). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 minutes, and were further re-suspended in complete medium and seeded as described above. A transfection e ciency of 40–60% was routinely obtained with a >90% co-transfection e ciency.
\n
\n### Pharmacological Treatment.
\n
\nAll chemicals were prepared as concentrated solutions according to the rec- ommendations of the di erent manufacturers. Compounds were aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes and used once, to avoid repeated freezing/thawing processes. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C for no longer than two months. Care was taken to protect photosensitive molecules from light by wrapping the test tubes in aluminum foil. Drugs were extemporaneously diluted at their respective  nal concentration in DMEM containing 10% FBS+ N2+ B27 minus Anti-Oxidant (AO). In order to study the impact of Glucose on rotenone induced toxicity, two dis- tinct DMEM formulations di ering only in their glucose concentration were used. HG conditions correspond to DMEM, high glucose, Glutamax Supplement, Pyruvate ( ermo sher, Gibco, Cat ref 10569010) contain- ing 4.5 g.L−1 (25 mM) of glucose. LG condition corresponds to DMEM, low glucose, Glutamax Supplement, Pyruvate ( ermo sher, Gibco Cat ref 10567014) containing 1 g.L−1 (5 mM) of glucose. Ten days a er seeding, Rotenone (5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) with or without mdivi-1 (20 μM, Tocris) or SP 600125 (10 μM) diluted in LG or HG DMEM were applied for 24 or 48 h according to the treatment. A er treatment, neurons were  xed with Paraformaldehyde 4% (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes at room temperature then washed with PBS.
\n
\n### Immuno uorescence.
\n
\nCells were washed twice with D-PBS for 5 minutes and permeabilized for 30 minutes with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS. Primary antibodies PBS solutions were then added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. A er, two PBS rinses, cells were further incubated with solutions of the corresponding sec- ondary antibodies for two hours at room temperature.  e chips were then rinsed once with PBS and mounted in Mowiol-based medium.  e following primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: alpha-tubulin-FITC (Sigma); Microtubule Associated Protein -2 (Sigma; MAP-2, mouse or rabbit monoclonal (1/500); beta3-tubulin (Sigma; mouse monoclonal 1/500); cytochrome c (Cell Signaling 1/300). Species-speci c secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 350, 488, or 555 were used (1/500, Life Technologies,) to visualize bound primary antibodies.
\n
\nImage Acquisition. Images were acquired with an Axio-observer Z1 (Zeiss)  tted with a cooled CCD camera (CoolsnapHQ2, Ropert Scientific).  e microscope was controlled with Metamorph so ware (Molecular Imaging) and images were analyzed using ImageJ so ware (ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).
\n
\n### Quantification of axonal degeneration and neuronal survival.
\n
\nAxonal degeneration was assessed through beta3-tubulin staining as previously described in ref. 13. Briefly, while beta3-tubulin immunostaining was continuous and homogenous in healthy axons, it appeared punctiform in fragmented axons.  e percentage of fragmented axons was calculated by computing the area ratio of circular fragmented axons segments over the total area of axons (six images per axonal chamber). For each condition, cell survival was estimated in the somatic chamber by calculating the percentage of condensed nuclei a er Hoechst labeling. Reported values are means of at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Retrograde axonal degeneration was assessed on CGN co-transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFPN1 (Clontech) and plasmids encoding Empty, OPA1G300E or DRP1. Ten days a er electroporation, axonal endings were challenged with 5 μM rotenone for 18 hours. Overlapping images were capture on live neurons, in order to recreate a mosaic image encompassing the somatic, micro-channel and distal areas. Axonal degeneration was assessed by computing the fragmentation index in 2 contiguous micro-channel areas, namely proximal ( first half of the micro-channel) and distal (second half of the microchannel).

\n###Mitochondrial morphology analysis and mitochondria speed analysis.
\n
\nMitochondrial morphol- ogy was assessed from cytochrome c or TOM20  uorescent immunostaining or transfected Mito-DsRed  uo- rescent signal. Images were acquired using 63X and mitochondrial morphological analysis was performed with Image J. Based on length, mitochondria were grouped in three classes: spherical mitochondria or mitochondria with a size under or equal at 2 μm,  lamentous mitochondria between 2 and 4 μm and hyper- lamentous above 4 μm. Mitochondria speed analysis was carried out by video-microscopy with an incubation chamber at 37 °C. We captured 10 minute movies with 12 frames per minute using a 63X oil-objective.  en kymographs are extracted with Image J (plugin Kymograph) and the mitochondria speed is calculated with the kymograph slope.
\n
\n### Statistical Analysis.
\n
\nDifferences were monitored by 1 way ANOVA and a two way ANOVA for mito- chondrial size (Fig. 2c), followed by a post-hoc Bonferoni test. For all analyses: *p-value, 0.05; **p-value, 0.01; ***p-value, 0.001.

\nLoss-of-function mutations in the PINK1 gene lead to recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease. Animal
\nmodels with depleted PINK1 expression have failed to reproduce significant nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration
\nand clear alpha-synuclein pathology, main characteristics of the disease. In this study, we
\ninvestigated whether alpha-synuclein pathology is altered in the absence of PINK1 in cell culture and
\nin vivo.We observed that downregulation of PINK1 enhanced alpha-synuclein aggregation and apoptosis
\nin a neuronal cell culture model for synucleinopathy. Silencing of PINK1 expression in mouse substantia
\nnigra using recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors did not induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration
\nin a long-term study up to 10 months, nor did it enhance or accelerate dopaminergic neurodegeneration
\nafter alpha-synuclein overexpression. However, in PINK1 knockout mice, overexpression of alphasynuclein
\nin the substantia nigra resulted in enhanced dopaminergic neurodegeneration as well as
\nsignificantly higher levels of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at serine 129 at 4 weeks postinjection. In
\nconclusion, our results demonstrate that total loss of PINK1 leads to an increased sensitivity to alphasynuclein-
\ninduced neuropathology and cell death in vivo.
\n
\n
\n#1. Introduction
\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is the most prevalent human neurodegenerative
\nmovement disorder, affecting 1%e2% of the worldwide
\npopulation aged older than 65 years. PD is characterized by
\nthe selective and progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons of
\nthe substantia nigra (SN), which results in major motor symptoms
\nsuch as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, resting tremor, and gait
\ndisturbances. Another neuropathologic cardinal feature of the disease
\nis the presence of alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein)-rich inclusions,
\nnamed Lewy bodies (LBs), in the surviving neurons
\n(Spillantini et al., 1997).
\nPD was long considered a sporadic disease with aging and
\nenvironmental toxins as its main risks factors. However, over the
\npast decade, mutations in several genes, among which a-synuclein
\n
\nand PINK1, have been identified in inherited PD (Farrer, 2006;
\nGasser, 2009). These genetic forms of the disease account for
\n5%e10% of the total cases of PD and share features with the sporadic
\nforms of the disease. Although the etiology of PD remains unclear,
\nmounting evidence suggests a similar mechanistic pathway leading
\nto the dopaminergic cell death at the origin of both idiopathic and
\nfamilial forms of PD, including protein misfolding, mitochondrial
\ndysfunction, and oxidative stress (Dawson and Dawson, 2003). For
\nthis reason, gaining knowledge into the molecular basis of the
\nmonogenic forms of PD may facilitate the understanding of the
\nmore common sporadic forms of the disease.
\nLoss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding PINK1 (PTENinduced
\nkinase 1) lead to autosomal recessive PD and have also
\nbeen identified as a cause of sporadic PD (Valente et al., 2004a,
\n2004b). The PINK1 gene is located in the PARK6 locus and encodes
\na highly conserved putative serine and/or threonine kinase.
\nBecause of the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting
\nmotif, the protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria,
\npossibly with its kinase domain facing the cytoplasm, allowing
\npossible interactions with cytosolic proteins (Zhou et al., 2008).
\nPINK1 exerts a neuroprotective effect under situations of severe
\noxidative stress. It has been shown in cells that overexpression of
\nwild-type (WT) PINK1, but not of its PD-associated mutants, protects
\nagainst apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition, oxidative
\nstress, and mitochondrial toxins (Deng et al., 2005; Haque et al.,
\n2008; Klinkenberg et al., 2010; Plun-Favreau et al., 2007; Pridgeon
\net al., 2007; Sandebring et al., 2009; Valente et al., 2004b). More
\nrecently, PINK1 was demonstrated to play a crucial role in
\nmitophagy, a cellular process by which mitochondrial structural
\nunity is maintained through selective autophagic clearance of
\ndamaged mitochondria (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010;
\nNarendra et al., 2010).
\nSince the exact molecular mechanism by which PINK1-related
\neffects occur remains largely elusive, several PINK1 lossof-
\nfunction animal models have been developed in the past years
\nto contribute to the understanding of human PD. Intriguingly,
\nalthough fly models lacking PINK1 expression display a drastic
\nphenotype, ranging from mitochondrial dysfunction to significant
\ndopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits (Clark et al.,
\n2006; Park et al., 2006), the PINK1 knockout and knockdown
\nmouse models developed so far display mild neurodegenerative
\nchanges (see, Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2011 for a review). Furthermore,
\nthey do not reproduce the main hallmarks of PDd the progressive
\ndopaminergic cell loss in the SN and the presence of LB-like pathology.
\nIn this context, increased a-synuclein aggregation was
\nreported in synucleinopathy cell culture models in which PINK1
\nwas silenced via RNA interference (Liu et al., 2009) but an elaborate
\nstudy of a-synuclein toxicity in rodents is still missing.
\nIn the present study, we investigated whether a-synuclein pathology
\ndiffers in the absence of PINK1 in cell culture and in vivo.
\nFirst, we showed that the downregulation of PINK1 enhances
\na-synuclein aggregation and cell death in our synucleinopathy cell
\nculture model. Next, we generated PINK1 knockdown mice by local
\ndelivery of a rAAV2/7-mediated, microRNA-based, short-hairpin
\nRNA against PINK1, which we have recently optimized to achieve
\nthe most potent knockdown (Heeman et al., 2011; Osorio et al.,
\n2014). We observed that the prolonged downregulation of PINK1
\nin mouse SN did not induce dopaminergic cell death in a long-term
\nstudy up to 10 months.We examined the vulnerability of the nigral
\ndopaminergic neurons to a-synuclein toxicity when the PINK1
\nlevels were reduced or absent. For this approach, we delivered a
\nrAAV2/7-a-synuclein WT vector to the SN of both PINK1 knockdown
\nand PINK1 knockout mice. Our data show that a-synucleininduced
\nneurodegeneration and neuropathology is enhanced in the
\nPINK1 knockout mice but not after local knockdown in mouse SN.
\n
\n#2. Methods
\n##2.1. Lentiviral vector design and production
\n
\nLentiviral (LV) vectors encoding for a-synuclein, PINK1 knockdown,
\nor the empty plasmid pCHMWS-blasticidin (control), under
\nthe control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, were prepared inhouse
\nas described earlier with the triple transfection method
\n(Geraerts et al., 2005). The knockdown construct was generated
\nusing 2 repeats of a microRNA-based, short-hairpin RNA, hereafter
\nreferred to as miR, against PINK1 messenger RNA (mRNA). The
\nartificial multiple-miR hairpins were generated using a micro-
\nRNA30 scaffold as previously described (Sun et al., 2006), in which
\nthe target sequence was replaced by 2 miR repeats of a functional
\nshort-hairpin sequence against PINK1 previously published (Zhou
\net al., 2007). Detailed cloning, efficiency, and functionality of the
\nnewly generated PINK1 knockdown construct in cell culture has
\nbeen shown elsewhere (Heeman et al., 2011; Osorio et al., 2014).
\nThe LV vectors induced co-expression of the hygromycin selection marker (for a-synuclein) from the same transcript via an internal
\nribosome entry site or blasticidin (for PINK1 knockdown and
\ncontrol).
\n
\n## 2.2. Generation of polyclonal stable overexpression cell lines using
\nLV vectors
\n
\nHuman neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco
\nmodified Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with
\n15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 50 mg/mL gentamycin
\n(Invitrogen), and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) referred
\nto herein as DMEM-complete, at 37 C and 5% CO2 in a humidified
\natmosphere. Transduction was performed as previously described
\n(Deleersnijder et al., 2011).
\n
\n##2.3. Synucleinopathy cell culture model
\nWe used the cell culture model described by Ostrerova-Golts
\net al. (2000) with minor modifications as previously described
\n(Gerard et al., 2010). Briefly, cells were treated for 72 hours with
\n100 mMH2O2 and 5 mM freshly prepared FeCl2 in DMEM-complete
\nand filtered through a 0.20-mm filter (Corning Inc, New York, NY,
\nUSA). After 3 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
\nsaline (PBS) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Cells
\nwere stored in PBS until analysis.

\n##2.4. High-content analysis of a-synuclein aggregation and cell
\ndeath
\nTo quantify a-synuclein aggregation and apoptosis in our synucleinopathy
\ncell culture model, we used the IN Cell Analyzer 1000
\nand IN Cell Investigator software (GE Healthcare) as described
\nbefore (Gerard et al., 2010).
\n
\n##2.5. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vector design and
\nproduction
\nThe plasmids for the rAAV vector production were previously
\ndescribed (Gao et al., 2005). These plasmids include the construct
\nfor the AAV2/7 serotype, the AAV transfer plasmid, and the pAdv-
\nDeltaF6 adenoviral helper plasmid. The transfer plasmid encoded
\neither 2 miR repeats against the monomeric red fluorescent protein
\n(miR-ctrl) or against PINK1 (miR-PINK1) preceded by the enhanced
\ngreen fluorescent protein (eGFP), or the human WT a-synuclein
\ntransgene. The transfer plasmid also contained the CMVieenhanced
\nsynapsin1 promoter to drive transgene expression and
\nthe woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regulatory element.
\nThe viral vectors were produced at the Leuven Viral Vector Core
\nfrom the KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). Vector production and
\npurification were performed as described in detail elsewhere (Van
\nder Perren et al., 2011). The final titers of the concentrated vector
\nstocks ranged between 6.4 1011 and 2.4 1012 genome copies per
\nmilliliter (GC/mL) as determined by quantitative polymerase chain
\nreaction.
\n
\n##2.6. Stereotactic surgery
\nHousing and handling of mice was done in compliance with the
\nEuropean Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986
\n(86/609/EEC) and approved by the Bioethical Committee of the KU
\nLeuven. We have previously described the generation of PINK1
\nknockout mice (PINK1/) and their control littermates (PINK1./.)
\n(Heeman et al., 2011). Female, 8-week-old, C57BL/6 mice were
\ninjected with rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl or rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1 vector
\ndiluted at 1.5  1011 GC/mL. The human WT a-synuclein rAAV2/7
\ntransduced the SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing a-synuclein with an
\nLV vector encoding a control plasmid or 2 miRNA-based, shorthairpin
\nRNA repeats (miR) against PINK1 (PINK1 knockdown).
\nKnockdown of PINK1 expression was confirmed using a quantitative
\nreal-time polymerase chain reaction (Fig.1A).We observed that
\nthe downregulation of PINK1 by means of an LV vector significantly
\nincreased the aggregation of a-synuclein in the synucleinopathy
\ncell culture model when compared with control (Fig. 1B). In addition,
\nwe determined the effect of PINK1 knockdown on nucleus
\ncondensation and fragmentation as a measure for cell death
\n(Fig. 1C). Similarly, to the effect on a-synuclein aggregation, the
\ndownregulation of PINK1 enhanced the number of late apoptotic
\ncells when compared with control.
\n
\n##3.2. rAAV2/7 vector-mediated knockdown of PINK1 in mouse SN
\ndoes not cause behavioral deficits or dopaminergic cell death
\nTo examine whether the downregulation of PINK1 influences asynuclein
\nneuropathology in vivo, we first studied PINK1 knockdown
\nby itself in adult mouse brain. For this approach, we used the
\nsame PINK1 knockdown construct as previously developed in an LV
\nvector for the cell culture assay but now delivered it in mouse SN in
\nthe context of a rAAV2/7 vector.
\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our viral vector to silence PINK1
\nexpression in mouse STR and SN, we used ISH because of the lack of
\nreliable and sensitive PINK1 antibodies available for immunohistochemical
\ndetection of endogenous mouse PINK1. At 2 weeks after
\ninjection of the rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1 or rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl in mouse
\nSTR or SN, brain tissues were processed for ISH. We observed a
\nrobust reduction in the PINK1 signal with the rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1
\nwhen compared with the contralateral side or the injected side of
\nrAAV2/7-miR-ctrl (Fig. 2A). Only 23% of PINK1 mRNA in the STR and
\n9% in the SN remained at 2 weeks after injection when transgene
\nexpression is known to be maximal (Fig. 2B).
\nNext, we performed a long-term follow-up study of the downregulation
\nof PINK1 in mouse SN. We assessed behavioral performance
\nin the cylinder test at 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months postinjection
\n(Fig. 2C). All groups performed similarly and no impairment was
\nobserved. We also monitored the weight of these animals and no
\ndifferences were observed between groups (data not shown). In
\naddition, we stained the nigral dopaminergic neurons for the
\ndopaminergic marker TH, to evaluate their survival upon PINK1
\nsilencing (Fig. 2E). Stereological quantification of the number of THpositive
\nneurons in the SN showed no differences over time between
\ngroups (Fig. 2D), indicating that PINK1 downregulation by
\nitself does not induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Because
\nboth knockdown viral vectors contained the same reporter gene,
\nwe performed immunohistochemical stainings for GFP, which
\nenabled us to demonstrate stable transgene expression in the
\ninjected area over time (Fig. 2F).
\n
\n##3.3. Local PINK1 knockdown in mouse SN does not enhance
\na-synuclein-induced neuropathology
\nWe have previously characterized the delivery of a rAAV2/7-asynucleinWT
\nvector in adult mouse SN (Oliveras-Salva et al., 2013).
\nWe observed that the overexpression of a-synuclein led to a strong
\nand progressive dopaminergic neuron loss in mouse SN, which
\nranged from 19% to 57% cell death at 4 weeks after injection,
\ndepending on the vector dose. In the present study, we used the
\nintermediate vector dilution of the past study for the overexpression
\nof a-synuclein (4.0  1011 GC/mL) that induced 45% THpositive
\ncell loss at 4 weeks postinjection. We chose this dose
\nbecause we reasoned that a slow progression of the neurodegeneration
\nmight easily allow us to distinguish possible differences
\nbetween groups.
\nTo investigate whether a-synuclein-induced dopaminergic
\nneurodegeneration differs when PINK1 is downregulated, we
\nunilaterally coinjected the rAAV2/7-a-synuclein WT vector
\ntogether with the rAAV2/7-miR-ctrl vector or rAAV2/7-miR-PINK1
\nvector in mouse SN. We performed fluorescent triple immunostainings
\nto assess the expression of both transgenes. At 5 days
\npostinjection, we observed a widespread expression of both asynuclein
\nand GFP proteins in the injected area (Fig. 3A). Colocalization
\nof a-synuclein and GFP with TH indicated an efficient
\ntransduction of the targeted nigral dopaminergic neurons distributed
\nthroughout the SN pars compacta.
\nWe assessed the behavioral performance of the mice in the
\ncylinder test at 5 days and 4 weeks postinjection (Fig. 3B). All
\ngroups behaved similarly and no clear impairments were observed.
\nNext, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for TH in the
\nSN (Fig. 3C). We observed a progressive and significant dopaminergic
\ncell loss over time in both groups, which is consistent with
\nthe localized overexpression of rAAV2/7-a-synuclein in mouse SN
\n(Fig. 3D). However, no clear differences in the percentage of
\nremaining TH-positive neurons were observed when PINK1 was
\ndownregulated compared with controls (miR-ctrl: 23% at 2 weeks
\nand 46% at 4 weeks; miR-PINK1: 26% at 2 weeks and 49% at
\n4 weeks) (Fig. 3E). To confirm the dopaminergic cell loss and not a
\nTH downregulation we performed a staining for VMAT, another
\ndopaminergic marker. This marker also showed a reduced staining
\nin the SN of the injected side compared with the non-injected side
\n(Supplementary Fig. 3).
\nTo evaluate the expression of the transgene over time in the
\ninjected region, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for
\nhuman a-synuclein. We observed a clear increase in a-synuclein
\nexpression at 2 weeks postinjection, followed by a significant
\ndecrease at 4 weeks postinjection to a similar extent for both
\nknockdown viral vectors (Fig. 4A). Quantification of the total
\nnumber a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN did not reveal significant
\ndifferences in a-synuclein expression between groups at any of
\nthe 3 different time points (Fig. 4C).
\nIn parallel, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for
\nP-S129 a-synuclein (Fig. 4B). This phosphorylated form of asynuclein
\nat serine residue at position 129 (P-S129) mainly accumulates
\nin the LBs (Anderson et al., 2006; Fujiwara et al.,
\n2002), thus, it is considered as a neuropathologic marker for asynuclein.
\nOverall, we observed a net increase in the number of
\nP-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN at 4 weeks postinjection
\nfor both knockdown conditions without clear
\ndifferences between groups (Fig. 4D). When calculating the
\npercentage of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN by
\ndetermining the ratio between the number of P-S129 a-synuclein-
\npositive cells (Fig. 4D) and the total number of a-synucleinpositive
\ncells (Fig. 4C) estimated in the SN, the PINK1 knockdown
\ncondition displayed an enhanced increase in the percentage of PS129
\na-synuclein-positive cells in the SN, although this was not
\nsignificant (Fig. 4E). In conclusion, these results indicate that asynuclein-
\ninduced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is not significantly
\naltered when PINK1 is downregulated. Also, at a later time
\npoint of 4 months postinjection, no significant differences in
\nbehavioral performance, dopaminergic cell survival, or a-synuclein
\nexpression were observed between groups (data not
\nshown).
\n
\n##3.4. Enhanced a-synuclein-induced dopaminergic cell death and
\nphosphorylation in PINK1 knockout mice
\nNext to the simultaneous delivery of rAAV2/7-a-synuclein with
\nthe PINK1 knockdown vector, we unilaterally injected the a-synuclein
\noverexpressing viral vector in the SN of PINK1 knockout mice
\n(PINK1/) and theirWT age-matched control littermates (PINK1./.),
\nwhich were previously developed by our group (Heeman et al.,
\n2011). To examine the susceptibility of the PINK1 knockout
\nmice to a-synuclein-induced toxicity, we performed immunohistochemical
\nstainings for TH at 5 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and
\n9 weeks after injection (Fig. 5A). In agreement with the rate of
\nneurodegeneration induced in the PINK1 knockdown or control
\ngroups described previously, we observed a progressive and
\nsignificant loss of the nigral dopaminergic neurons over time in
\nboth groups (Fig. 5B). Stereological quantification of the
\nremaining TH-positive neurons showed a differential degree of
\nTH cell loss between groups (Fig. 5C). At 4 weeks after injection,
\nstereological counts revealed a 36% TH-positive neuron loss
\nrespective to the contralateral side in WT mice, whereas 49% of
\nthe TH-positive nigral cells were lost in the PINK1 knockout
\nmice. A similar trend was observed at 9 weeks postinjection,
\nalthough this difference was not significant (PINK1./.: 53%;
\nPINK1/: 60%).
\n
\nNext, we stained the nigral sections for human a-synuclein to
\nevaluate the expression of the transgene over time in the injected
\nregion. As expected, we observed an increase in expression until
\n2 weeks postinjection, followed by a significant decrease at 4 weeks
\nafter injection (Fig. 6A and E). Similarly to the dopaminergic cell
\ncounts, we observed a more pronounced loss of a-synuclein-positive
\ncells in PINK1 knockout mice when compared with their control
\nlittermates at 4 weeks postinjection (PINK1./.: 3350  359;
\nPINK1/: 2781  449). A similar trend was observed at 9 weeks
\npostinjection, yet not significant (PINK1./.: 2968  206; PINK1/:
\n2120  403). Interestingly, a-synuclein expression significantly
\ndeclined in PINK1 knockout mice at 9 weeks postinjection, whereas
\nthe total number of a-synuclein-positive cells did not substantially
\ndiffer from 4 to 9 weeks postinjection in the WT group.
\nTo investigate the pathologic nature of the remaining a-synucleinpositive
\ncells,we performed fluorescent double immunostainings for
\na-synuclein and ubiquitin because immunohistochemical studies
\nhave shown that ubiquitin is amajor constituent of the LB (Spillantini
\net al., 1997). At 4 weeks postinjection, we visualized a clear colocalization
\nof a-synuclein and ubiquitin (Fig. 6D). In addition, we
\nexamined a-synuclein-related pathology by means of 2 stereological
\nquantification methods. Firstly, we estimated the percentage of asynuclein-
\npositive cells containing aggregates in the SN (Fig. 6FeH).
\nFor this approach, we visually scored the nigral a-synuclein-positive
\ncells for the presence of LB-like inclusions in their cytoplasm at high
\nmagnification. Examples of an a-synuclein-positive cell without and
\nwith aggregates are displayed in Fig. 6B and C, respectively. We
\nobserved a progressive increase over time in the percentage of
\naggregate-positive cells inthe SNfor bothconditions. Thiswas slightly
\nenhanced in PINK1 knockoutmice throughout thewhole time course
\nof the experiment (PINK1./.: 18% at 5 days, 22% at 2 weeks, 37% at
\n4weeks, and 50% at 9weeks; PINK1/: 21% at 5 days, 32% at 2weeks,
\n42% at 4 weeks, and 56% at 9 weeks) (Fig. 6F).
\nSubsequently, we stained for P-S129 a-synuclein in the SN and
\nwe observed a progressive increase over time for both groups up to
\n4 weeks after injection (Fig. 7A and B). Likewise, the estimation of
\nthe percentage of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells in the SN
\nrevealed a gradual increase over time for both groups up to 4 weeks
\npostinjection (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the 9 weeks time point
\nexhibited less P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells for both conditions,
\nbut it was more substantially reduced in the PINK1 knockout mice.
\nWe have previously reported that a maximum is reached in the
\nnumber of P-S129 a-synuclein-positive cells following delivery of
\nthis rAAV2/7-a-synuclein vector in mice, after which the vast cell
\ndeath (over 50% dopaminergic neuron loss) affects the P-S129 asynuclein
\ncounts (Oliveras-Salvá M. et al., 2013). The total number
\nand the percentage of phosphorylated S129 a-synuclein-positive
\ncells was significantly higher in the SN of PINK1 knockout mice
\ncompared with WT mice at 4 weeks postinjection. In addition,
\nPINK1 knockout mice showed a trend to an enhanced increase in
\nthe percentage of phosphorylated S129 a-synuclein-positive cells at
\nall time points (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results indicate that
\ncomplete in vivo depletion of PINK1 sensitizes the dopaminergic
\nneurons to a-synuclein-induced cell death and neuropathology.
\n
\n#4. Discussion
\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate whether asynuclein
\nneuropathology differs in the absence of PINK1 in cell
\nculture and in vivo. We showed that the downregulation of
\nPINK1 enhanced a-synuclein aggregation and apoptotic cell
\ndeath in a neuronal cell culture model for synucleinopathy. This
\nresult is in agreement with a previous study reporting that the
\nloss of PINK1 leads to increased detergent-insoluble aggregates
\nin a neuronal cell culture model overexpressing either WT or
\nA53T a-synuclein (Liu et al., 2009). In vivo, we reported
\nthat PINK1 knockdown does not lead to dopaminergic cell death
\nby itself nor enhance the dopaminergic neurodegeneration
\ninduced by rAAV2/7 vector-mediated overexpression of WT asynuclein.
\nIn contrast, we observed that PINK1 knockout mice
\nare more vulnerable to a-synuclein-induced cell death and
\nneuropathology.
\nThe identification of gene mutations leading to rare Mendelian
\nforms of PD has impelled the development of several animal
\nmodels. In the case of PINK1, fly, worm, and fish models exhibit a
\nrobust phenotype with neurodegeneration, motor deficits, mitochondrial
\nimpairment, and vulnerability to toxins (Anichtchik et al.,
\n2008; Park et al., 2006; Sallinen et al., 2010; Samann et al., 2009; Xi
\net al., 2010; Yang et al., 2006). Conversely, PINK1 knockout and
\nknockdown mice developed so far are characterized by a mild
\nphenotype with mitochondrial deficits and sensitivity to oxidative
\nstress-inducing toxins (Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2011). They do not
\nreproduce the main features of PDd the progressive degeneration
\nof the nigral dopaminergic neurons and the presence of cytoplasmic
\na-synuclein-rich inclusions. Only a nonsignificant increase
\nin a-synuclein protein levels but in contrast, a relevant decrease in
\nmRNA levels has been reported in the brain stem and midbrain of 2-
\nyear-old PINK1 knockout mice (Gispert et al., 2009). These results
\nsuggest that a-synuclein degradation and resynthesis might be
\nimpaired, indicating a hurdle in protein clearance. In patients with
\nsporadic PD and PD associated with heterozygous PINK1 mutations,
\nPINK1 has been detected in LBs (Gandhi et al., 2006; Murakami
\net al., 2007). The sole neuropathologic report from a PD patient
\nwith homozygous PARK6 mutations showed that PINK1-linked PD
\ninduces LB pathology (Samaranch et al., 2010).
\nWe reasoned that adult knockdownof PINK1might induce amore
\nsevere phenotype because of the acute nature of the knockdownwith
\nless opportunity for compensatory changes. Indeed, adult local loss of
\nparkin function was shown to result in dopaminergic cell loss after
\n10 months (Shin et al., 2011). In the past, we have used lentiviral
\nvectors for stable and long-term silencing of target genes in the central
\nnervous system using short-hairpin RNAs (Van den Haute et al.,
\n2003). RNA interference is a mechanism present in all eukaryotic
\ncells to halt the expression of targeted genes, which involves processing
\nof so-called microRNA structures (He and Hannon, 2004).
\nThus, the use of artificial microRNAs might provide a better tool for
\ntargeted gene silencing studies in vivo as they mimic the natural
\nprocess ongoing in the cell (McBride et al., 2008). In addition,we have
\nshown that rAAV vectors efficiently transduce nigral dopaminergic
\nneurons (Van der Perren et al., 2011). Based on this, we selected the
\nrAAV2/7 serotype because of its high transduction efficiency of the
\ndopaminergic neurons invivo, andwe combined itwith an optimized
\nmiR-based construct (Heeman et al., 2011) (Osório et al., 2014). Here,
\nwe reported the development and characterization of a PINK1
\nknockdownmouseby deliveryof a specificmiR-basedrAAV2/7vector.
\nWe have successfully shown efficient knockdown of PINK1 both in
\nSTR and SN of adult mouse. However, this did not induce dopaminergic
\nneurodegeneration in the time scope of our study. Previous
\nstudies have reported the absence of neurodegeneration in the SN of
\nPINK1 knockoutmice upto 19months old (Akundi et al., 2011;Gispert
\net al., 2009; Glasl et al., 2012; Kitada et al., 2007). A recent report
\nmimicking PINK1 loss-of-function via short-hairpin RNA adenoviral
\nvectordelivery inmouse striatumalsofailedto reproduce a significant
\ndopaminergic neurodegeneration (Haque et al., 2012). Taking into
\naccount the role of PINK1inmitochondrial stability,we cannot discard
\nthat the depletion of PINK1 expression might induce subtle cellular
\nmodifications not visible at the phenotypic level.
\nPINK1 knockout mice have shown susceptibility to oxidative
\nstress and vulnerability to neurotoxins (Gautier et al., 2008; Haque
\net al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011). In the present study, we evaluated
\nthe effect of a-synuclein neurotoxicity in the absence of PINK1
\nin vivo via 2 parallel approaches.We injected a rAAV2/7-a-synuclein
\nvector in the SN of both PINK1 knockout and knockdown mice. We
\nhave previously shown that delivery of rAAV2/7-a-synuclein vector
\nin mouse SN triggers a robust and progressive loss of dopaminergic
\nneurons, as well as marked a-synuclein-related neuropathology
\n(Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2013). We now report that the complete
\nablation of PINK1 sensitizes the nigral neurons to a-synuclein
\ntoxicity. Because rAAV2/7-a-synuclein induced the same rate of
\nneurodegeneration after local PINK1 knockdown as in the control
\ngroup, we suggest that the remaining PINK1 is sufficient to maintain
\nthe dopaminergic cell function within the time frame of our study.
\nOver the last years, much attention has been dedicated to the
\nstudy of mitochondrial dysfunction as an important cause of the
\ndopaminergic cell death seen in PD patients. To date, it is still unknown
\nhow a-synuclein mediates its cytotoxic effects, but it has been reported that a-synuclein causes cytochrome c release
\nand reduces mitochondrial complex I activity, indicating that asynuclein
\nalso regulates mitochondrial function and dynamics
\n(Devi et al., 2008; Parihar et al., 2008). Although the link between asynuclein
\npathology and mitochondrial dysfunction remains
\nunclear, several groups have demonstrated that, in pathologic
\nconditions, a-synuclein can translocate to the mitochondria via an
\nN-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting that it
\nmight interfere with mitochondrial function (Cole et al., 2008; Devi
\net al., 2008). In worms, mitochondrial fragmentation induced by
\nexpression of a-synuclein is rescued by co-expression of PINK1
\n(Kamp et al., 2010). In flies, overexpression of PINK1 rescues motor
\nand developmental defects induced by a-synuclein (Todd and
\nStaveley, 2008, 2012). PINK1 plays a crucial role in mitochondrial
\nviability by the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria in
\nconcert with parkin in a cellular autophagic process called
\nmitophagy (Geisler et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010; Narendra et al.,
\n2010). In addition, PINK1 has been described to exert a neuroprotective
\nand pro-survival effect under situations of oxidative
\nstress-induced cell death via several proteins and pathways. Recent
\nfindings have shown that the mitochondrial chaperone protein
\nTRAP1, substrate of PINK1, mitigates motor deficits and dopaminergic
\nneurodegeneration in A53T a-synuclein-expressing flies
\n(Butler et al., 2012). Phosphorylation of TRAP1 by PINK1 protects
\nthe mitochondria against cell death induced by oxidative stress and
\nprevents cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Pridgeon
\net al., 2007).
\nTaken together, we have shown that a-synuclein neuropathology
\nis exacerbated in the absence of PINK1. Whether there is a
\ndirect interaction of PINK1 and a-synuclein awaits further research,
\nbut our findings might help to elucidate the link between mitochondrial
\ndysfunction and a-synucleinopathy in mammalian brain
\nand provide new therapeutic targets.

\n#Abstract
\nParkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related, neurodegenerative motor disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and presence of α-synuclein-containing protein aggregates. Mutations in the mitochondrial Ser/Thr kinase PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are associated with an autosomal recessive familial form of early-onset PD. Recent studies have suggested that PINK1 plays important neuroprotective roles against mitochondrial dysfunction by phosphorylating and recruiting Parkin, a cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase, to facilitate elimination of damaged mitochondria via autophagy-lysosomal pathways. Loss of PINK1 in cells and animals leads to various mitochondrial impairments and oxidative stress, culminating in dopaminergic neuronal death in humans. Using a 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proteomics approach, the differences in expressed brain proteome and phosphoproteome between 6-month-old PINK1-deficient mice and wild-type mice were identified. The observed changes in the brain proteome and phosphoproteome of mice lacking PINK1 suggest that defects in signaling networks, energy metabolism, cellular proteostasis, and neuronal structure and plasticity are involved in the pathogenesis of familial PD.

\nMutations in PINK1 are associated with an early-onset form of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examines changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome of the PINK1 knockout mouse brain. Alterations were noted in several key proteins associated with: increased oxidative stress, aberrant cellular signaling, altered neuronal structure, decreased synaptic plasticity, reduced neurotransmission, diminished proteostasis networks, and altered metabolism. 14-3-3ε, 14-3-3 protein epsilon; 3-PGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; ALDOA, aldolase A; APT1, acyl-protein thioesterase 1; CaM, calmodulin; CBR3, carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 3; ENO2, gamma-enolase; HPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; HSP70, heat-shock-related 70 kDa protein 2; IDHc, cytoplasmic isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP+]; MAPK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; MEK1, MAP kinase kinase 1; MDHc, cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase; NFM, neurofilament medium polypeptide; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; PHB, prohibitin; PINK1, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1; PPIaseA, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A; PSA2, proteasome subunit alpha type-2; TK, transketolase; VDAC-2, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2.

\nParkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. The relative risk of developing PD increases with age and approximately 1–2% of the population above 65 years is affected (Twelves et al. 2003; Pilsl and Winklhofer 2012). PD is characterized by the accumulation of Serine-129 phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates (Anderson et al. 2006) within Lewy bodies and the loss of the majority of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, causing drastically diminished dopamine release in the striatum (Braak et al. 2003). In addition to the cardinal motor symptoms (resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability), PD patients frequently suffer from a variety of non-motor symptoms that may occur decades earlier and include cognitive decline, depression, hallucinations, REM sleep disorder, and anosmia (Chaudhuri et al. 2006; Jankovic 2008). Although the precise cause of PD remains elusive, significant contributing factors are believed to include exposure to environmental toxins, oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and failure of proteostasis networks associated with protein aggregation (Henchcliffe and Beal 2008; Bueler 2009; Tansey and Goldberg 2010).
\nWhile the majority of PD cases are sporadic, an estimated 5–10% of patients develop PD as a result of inheritable mutations in one of several genes (Gasser et al. 2011). Mutations in Pink1 are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive familial early-onset PD (Valente et al. 2004; Bonifati et al. 2005; Bonifati 2012). PINK1 is a mitochondrial kinase consisting of 581 amino acids that encode for a mitochondrial targeting sequence, a transmembrane domain and a Ser/Thr kinase domain. PINK1 is believed to confer neuroprotection by policing mitochondrial integrity (Narendra et al. 2010; Jin and Youle 2012), and a growing amount of research links dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics with PD (Heeman et al. 2011; Hauser and Hastings 2013; Van Laar and Berman 2013). DA neurons may be particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress because of reduced mitochondrial reserve compared to other types of neurons and the reliance on calcium influx for pace-making (Liang et al. 2007; Surmeier et al. 2011). In normal cells with healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is imported to the inner mitochondrial membrane where the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved by the mitochondrial protease, PARL (Deas et al. 2011; Meissner et al. 2011). Subsequently, PINK1 is retro-translocated to the cytosol where it is degraded by the proteasome (Yamano and Youle 2013). However, a proportion of PINK1 remains in the cytoplasm (Haque et al. 2008; Lin and Kang 2008) and cytosolic PINK1 has been implicated in the regulation of various pathways, including AKT signal transduction and cell survival, synaptic plasticity, DA synthesis, and mitophagy (Akundi et al. 2012; Fedorowicz et al. 2014; Haque et al. 2008; Murata et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2014). Import of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane is blocked when the mitochondrial electron transport chain becomes dysfunctional and membrane potential (ΔΨm) is decreased (Matsuda et al. 2010; Amo et al. 2011). PINK1 then accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane where it phosphorylates Ser65 in the ubiquitin-like domain of the E3 ligase, Parkin, to initiate mitophagy (Kazlauskaite et al. 2014). When PINK1 kinase activity is inactivated in mice and flies via gene ablation, mitochondrial dysfunction ensues and structurally abnormal mitochondria accumulate in cells (Park et al. 2006; Exner et al. 2007; Gautier et al. 2008, 2012; Akundi et al. 2011, 2013; Heeman et al. 2011). Furthermore, mutations in PINK1 cause a decrease in mitochondrial complex I activity and ATP production, as well as elevated production of reactive oxygen species (Deas et al. 2011; Koh and Chung 2012; Morais et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2010).
\nIn this study, we utilized a 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) proteomics approach to identify proteins with differential expression levels and phosphorylation states in the brains of PINK1 knockout (KO) mice versus wild-type controls to further study the molecular mechanisms of PINK1-related PD.

\n
\n##Animals and brain tissue
\nThe male mice used in this study were provided by our collaborator and coauthor, Dr Hansruedi Büeler, when he was at the University of Kentucky. The generation and characterization of these PINK1-deficient mice has been described previously (Akundi et al. 2011). The animal housing facility regularly underwent serological testing to certify a healthy, virus, and pathogen free facility. Subjects were fed Richland Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001 and water ad libitum. The animal rooms were maintained with a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle (where lights were turned on at 6:00 a.m.) at 20–22°C. For the experimental groups of animals, n = 6 per group, whole brains were isolated from mice rendered unconscious by CO2 inhalation and killed by cervical dislocation using procedures approved by the UK Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Dissected brains were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.
\n
\n##Sample preparation
\nMouse brains were thawed and individual homogenates were prepared using a Wheaton glass homogenizer (~ 40 passes) with ice-cold isolation buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES, 0.2 μg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/mL leupeptin, 4 μg/mL pepstatin, 5 μg/mL aprotinin, and 5 μg/mL phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2). Homogenates were vortexed on ice and then sonicated on ice for 10 s at 20% power, two times, with a Fisher 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Protein concentrations of the homogenates were determined by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid method (Smith et al. 1985).
\nTwo-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
\n###Isoelectric focusing
\nIsoelectric focusing was performed as described previously (Sultana et al. 2007). Briefly, brain homogenate proteins (200 μg) were shaken for 2 h at 22°C in 200 μL of rehydration buffer [8 M urea, 2.0% (w/v) CHAPS, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM DTT, 0.2% Biolytes, 0.01% Bromophenol Blue]. Samples (200 μL) were applied to 11 cm pH 3–10 ReadyStrip IPG strips (linear gradient). Strips were actively rehydrated at 20°C for 18 h at 50 V. Next, the samples were isoelectrically focused at a constant temperature of 20°C beginning at 300 V for 2 h, 500 V for 2 h, 1000 V for 2 h, 8000 V for 8 h, and finishing at 8000 V for 10 h. IPG strips were stored at −80°C until second dimension separation (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS–PAGE).
\n###SDS–PAGE
\nIsoelectric focusing strips were thawed and equilibrated with buffer A and buffer B (buffer A [50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 6 M urea, 1% (w/v) SDS, 30% v/v glycerol, 0.5% DTT], buffer B [50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 6 M urea, 1% (w/v) SDS, 30% v/v glycerol, 4.5% IA]). IPG strips were next placed into Criterion precast linear gradient (8–16%) Tris–HCl polyacrylamide gels, 1 IPG + 1 Well Comb, 11 cm. Invitrogen PeppermintStick molecular weight marker and samples were run at a constant voltage of 200 V for approximately 65 min in Tris-Glycine SDS running buffer.
\n
\n##Gel staining
\nProteins and phosphoproteins were detected using SYPRO Ruby and Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain according to manufacturer's directions and as previously described (Di Domenico et al. 2011). Briefly, gels were fixed in solution [10% (v/v) acetic acid, 50% (v/v) methanol] (50 mL) and washed in deionized water. Next, 60 mL of Pro-Q Diamond stain was added with gentle rocking for 90 min. Gels were then destained four times for 30 min each in 100 mL of destaining solution [20% acetonitrile (ACN), 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4]. The gels were washed in deionized water and scanned at 580 nm using a GE Healthcare Life Sciences Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner. The gels were then stained overnight with 50 mL of Sypro Ruby gel stain. Gels were rinsed and placed in deionized water. Gels were scanned at 450 nm and then stored at 4°C until protein spot excision.
\n
\n##Image analysis
\n###Expression proteomics
\nSpot intensities from SYPRO Ruby-stained 2D-gel images of wild-type (WT) and PINK1 KO samples were quantified by densitometry using PDQuest 2-D Analysis Software (Bio-Rad). Intensities of each gel were normalized to the total density of each gel. Protein spots were manually and automatically matched with the PDQuest program. Spot densities in KO and WT samples were compared and spots with a statistically significant difference based on a Student's two-tailed t-test (p < 0.05) were considered for in-gel trypsin digestion and subsequent identification.
\n
\n###Phosphoproteomics
\nProtein spots from Pro-Q Diamond-stained 2D-gel images of PINK1−/− and WT samples were quantified and matched together in the same manner as the SYPRO Ruby-stained gels. Next, two master gels were chosen, one from the Pro-Q Diamond images and one from the Sypro Ruby-stained images. The phosphoprotein master image was then matched to the master Sypro Ruby-stained image in the same manner as described above. The PDQuest software provided numerical data corresponding to the intensity of the protein spot. The phosphoprotein spot densities were then normalized to the Sypro Ruby spot densities and the resultant normalized phosphoprotein spot densities in KO and WT samples were compared and spots with a statistically significant difference based on a Student's two-tailed t-test (p < 0.05) were considered for in-gel trypsin digestion and subsequent identification.
\n
\n##In-gel trypsin digestion/peptide extraction
\nProtein spots were excised from 2D-gels with a clean, sterilized razor blade and individually transferred to Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes for trypsin digestion as previously described (Thongboonkerd et al. 2002). Gel plugs were incubated with 20 μL of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) for 15 min, and with 30 μL of ACN for 15 min. Gel plugs were dried under a flow hood at 22°C for 30 min. Next, 30 μL of 20 mM DTT in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 was added at 56°C for 45 min. The DTT/NH4HCO3 solution was then removed and replaced with 30 μL of 0.05 M IA in 0.1 M NH4HCO3and incubated at 22°C for 15 min. Next, the IA solution was removed and plugs incubated for 15 min with 150 μL of 0.05 M NH4HCO3 at 22°C. Then, 200 μL ACN was added to this solution and incubated for 15 min at 22°C. Solvent was removed and gel plugs were allowed to dry for 30 min at 22°C under a flow hood. Plugs were rehydrated with modified trypsin solution in 0.05 M NH4HCO3 (enough to completely cover the gel plugs) and incubated with shaking overnight at 37°C. The next day, the salts and contaminants were removed from the tryptic peptide solutions using C18 ZipTips in accordance with manufacturer's directions. Samples were stored at −80°C until MS/MS analysis.
\n
\n##NanoLC-MS with data-dependent scan
\nSamples desalted with C18 Zip Tips were reconstituted in 10 μL 5% ACN/0.1% formic acid (FA) and analyzed by a nanoAcquity (Waters, Milford, MA, USA)-LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) system in data-dependent scan mode. An in-house packed capillary column (0.1 × 130 mm column packed with 3.6 μm, 200Å XB-C18) and a gradient with 0.1% FA and ACN/0.1% FA at 200 nL/min were used for separation. The MS spectra were acquired by the orbitrap at 30 000 resolution and MS/MS spectra of the six most intense ions in MS scan were obtained by the orbitrap at 7500 resolution. Data files from each sample were searched against the most current version of the Swiss-Prot database by SEQUEST (Proteome Discoverer v1.4; Thermo Scientific). At least two high-confidence peptide matches were required for protein identification (false discovery rate < 1%). Proteins matched with the same peptides are reported as one protein group.
\n
\n##Immunoprecipitation and western blotting validations
\n###Immunoprecipitation
\nWhole brain homogenized protein extracts (250 μg) were suspended in 500 μL immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer [0.05% NP-40, leupeptin 4 μg/mL, pepstatin 4 μg/mL, aproprotin 5 μg/mL, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 10 μg/mL in a phosphate buffer solution, pH 8 (8 M NaCl, 0.2 M KCl, 1.44 M Na2HPO4, 0.24 M KH2PO4, pH adjusted with NaOH)] and allowed to shake for 30 min at 4°C. Next, 50 μL of Protein A/G beads (per sample) was washed and centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C. The washed beads were added to the individual protein samples to pre-clear of non-specific protein A/G artifacts for 90 min at 4°C. Samples were then centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to new Eppendorf tubes with either anti-MAPK1 antibody (1 : 50 dilution) or anti-CaM antibody (1 : 50) and shaken overnight at 4°C. The next morning, 50 μL of protein A/G beads was washed as and incubated with the protein samples for 90 min at 4°C. After removing the supernatant, the beads were again washed five times with IP buffer with 10 min of shaking in IP buffer between centrifugations. The beads were preserved for a 1D-PAGE experiment.
\n
\n###One-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
\nWhole brain homogenates (50 μg) or beads from IP experiments were suspended in 4X sample loading buffer [0.5 M Tris, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Bromophenol Blue] diluted to 1X with distilled water, heated at 95°C for 5 min and cooled on ice. Samples and Precision Plus Protein All Blue Standards were loaded into a Criterion precast (4–12%) Bis-Tris polyacrylamide 12 or 18 well gels and run at 22°C in XT MOPS running buffer at 80 V for 15 min. The voltage was then increased to 120 V for approximately 100 min at 22°C for the duration of the electrophoretic run.
\n
\n###1D-western blotting
\n1D-gels were directly transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 nm) using a Trans-Blot Turbo Blotting System (Bio-Rad). After the transfer, membranes were incubated in a blocking solution of 3% bovine serum albumin in Wash Blot [150 mM NaCl, 3 mM NaH2PO4, 17 mM NaHPO4 and 0.04% (v/v) Tween 20] at 22°C for 1.5 h. Each protein of interest was detected by incubation with a primary antibody (1 : 8000 dilution), in blocking solution at 22°C with gentle rocking for 2 h. Blots were rinsed two times for 5 min each and one time for 10 min in Wash Blot, followed by a 1 h incubation with a HRP (1 : 3000) secondary antibody at 22°C with gentle rocking. Blots were rinsed three times for 5, 10, and 10 min each in Wash Blot and developed chemiluminescently using Clarity Western ECL substrate. After developing for 5 min at 22°C in the dark, blots were scanned using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system and quantified using Image Lab software (Hercules, CA, USA). Blots were rinsed and then stripped with Re-Blot Plus Strong solution for exactly 10 min at 22°C, followed by three 5 min rinses with Wash Blot. The membranes were then blocked once again in 3% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. Next, an anti-tubulin antibody (1 : 20 000) or anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (1 : 10 000) were added to the Wash Blot solution with 2 h more of gentle rocking at 22°C. Membranes were then washed, incubated with a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody, washed, developed chemiluminescently and scanned.
\n
\n##Statistical analysis
\nAll statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student's t-test, in which p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for western blot and PDQuest analysis. Fold-change values of easily discernible protein spots were determined by dividing the average, normalized spot intensities in the knockout gels by the average, normalized spot intensities of the wild-type gels. Only spots with a 1.25-fold change or greater in normalized spot density were considered for MS/MS analysis. Protein and peptide identifications obtained with the SEQUEST search algorithm with p < 0.01 were considered to be statistically significant.
\n
\n#Results
\nProteomic analyses of the isolated brain proteins were conducted using a 2D-PAGE approach with Sypro Ruby and Pro-Q Diamond staining in conjunction with MS/MS analysis. Protein spot intensities were compared between PINK1(−/−) and PINK1(+/+) control mice to determine differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins. Figure 1 shows representative examples obtained from SYPRO Ruby-stained 2-D gel images of the isolated proteins from 6-month-old PINK1(−/−) and PINK1(+/+) mice with significant differentially expressed proteins labeled. Figure 2 shows typical images of Pro-Q Diamond-stained gels with protein spots showing altered phosphorylation states labeled in the images. Graphs displaying normalized phosphorylation intensity of each sample are also provided. PDQuest analysis of all of the 2-D images found 29 protein spots suitable for extraction and whose expression or phosphorylation state was significantly altered in the brains of PINK1(−/−) mice as compared to the WT controls. After in-gel trypsin digestion and peptide extraction, MS/MS analysis coupled to interrogation of protein databases was utilized to determine the identity of the proteins. Tables 1 and 2 list the proteins in the brains of PINK1(−/−) mice that showed significantly altered expression or phosphorylation states. Other information listed in the tables include: the spot number as labeled by the PDQuest program, the SwissProt accession number, percentage of the protein sequence covered by matching peptides, the number of peptide sequences identified by the MS/MS analysis, the protein confidence score, the expected molecular weight and isoelectric point of the identified protein, as well as the fold-change levels and p-values obtained from the PDQuest analysis. Regarding fold-change values, a ↑1.33-fold means the protein expression in the KO brain is 33% more than in WT brain. A ↓0.0885-fold means protein expression in the KO brain is 91.15% less than in WT brain. All proteins were identified by more than one peptide sequence. Furthermore, identified protein spots were visually compared against the theoretical molecular weights and isoelectric points from the mass spectrometry analysis. The 23 brain proteins with significantly altered expression were identified as: neurofilament light peptide (NFL) (↓0.580-fold), V-type proton ATPase subunit F (↓0.725-fold), prohibitin (PHB) (↓0.464-fold), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP2, also called collapsing response-mediated protein 2, CRMP2) (↓0.0186-fold), heat-shock-related 70 kDa protein 2 (HSP70.2) (↓0.213-fold), acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) (↓0.0130-fold), carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 3 (CBR3) (↓0.0244-fold), proteasome subunit alpha type-2 (PSA2) (↓0.0898-fold), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) (↓0.0885-fold), malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic (↓0.0121-fold), actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (ARPC2) (↓0.0110-fold), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 (VDAC-2) (↓0.607-fold), isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP] cytoplasmic (↓0.226-fold), vesicle-fusing ATPase (↓0.0396-fold), elongation factor 2 (EF2) (↓0.411-fold) and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, also known as cyclophilin A (↓0.181-fold), gamma-enolase (ENO2) (↑1.24-fold), T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (↑1.33-fold), D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (↑3.69-fold), isoform 3 of dynamin-1 (↑1.41-fold), transgelin-3 (↑1.47-fold), fructose-bisphosphate ALDOA (↑2.99-fold), and transketolase (↑1.52-fold). The six proteins found to have differential phosphorylation states were as follows: CaM (↓0.418-fold), 14-3-3 protein epsilon (↓0.480-fold), neurofilament medium polypeptide (NSF) (↓0.275-fold), V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A (↓0.313-fold), dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (↑2.34-fold), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (↑3.39-fold).

\n##Immunoprecipitation and western blot validation experiments
\nTo validate the changes in protein expression and phosphorylation as determined by the PDQuest analysis of the 2-D gels, immunochemistry and 1-D western blotting analysis of PINK1(−/−) and WT samples was performed. Figure 3(a) and (b) shows the western blot images from the IP experiments after probing with anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, where the immunoprecipitated protein, MAPK1, and CaM, respectively, were used as the loading control. Figure 3(c) and (d) displays the corresponding histogram plot representations of the data. The findings from these analyses confirmed a significant increase in the phosphorylation of MAPK1 (p = 0.045) and a decrease in the phosphorylation of CaM (p = 0.032) in the brain of PINK1(−/−) mice. Figure 4(a) and (b) presents the western blot images of PINK1(−/−) and control samples after probing with antibodies for HSP70.2 and ALDOA, respectively, where tubulin was used as the loading control. Figure 4(c) and (d) is the corresponding bar graphs of the results. The results of the western blot analyses confirmed a significant decrease in the expression of HSP70.2 (p = 0.047) and a significant increase in the expression of ALDOA (p = 0.049) in the PINK1(−/−) model. The p-values of most of these results are slightly higher than the values obtained from the 2-D proteomic studies. These differences may be attributed to the sensitivity of the Sypro Ruby staining of the 2-D images as compared to the range limitations of the chemiluminescent development of the 1-D western blots.

\n#Discussion
\nThis study focuses on protein expression and phosphorylation changes in the brains of 6-month-old PINK1(−/−) mice compared to PINK1(+/+) mice. Six-month-old mice were selected based on the observation that at this age PINK1(−/−) mice begin to exhibit a PD phenotype, including reduced dopamine levels, providing a model to study early changes occurring in brains with PINK1-related disease progression (Akundi et al. 2011). Proteomics studies revealed 29 proteins with significantly altered expression or phosphorylation levels in the brains of PINK1 knockout mice (vs. control mice). These proteins can be subdivided into the following categories that are discussed separately below: cellular signaling, energy metabolism, proteostasis networks, oxidative stress, and neuronal plasticity, neurotransmission, and structure.
\n##Cellular signaling
\nRegulation of protein phosphorylation status by protein kinases and protein phosphatases is essential in the control of cellular signaling pathways. Ablation of the kinase PINK1 in mice revealed de-regulated downstream phosphorylation events in the brain that may contribute to familial PINK1-related PD pathogenesis. Interestingly, lack of PINK1 is associated with increased phosphorylation of both MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and its downstream target MAPK1 that modulate vital functions including cell cycle, immunity, autophagy, apoptosis, and cell survival (Dzamko et al. 2014). Interestingly, it has been reported that PINK1 deficiency resulted in increased p38 phosphorylation leading to dysfunction of astrocytes (Choi et al. 2013). In many neurodegenerative disorders, MAPKs display increased activity and can produce substantial physiological effects with only modest changes in their phosphorylation state (Zhu et al. 2003; Di Domenico et al. 2011). Phosphorylated MAPKs have been shown to aggregate in the halo region of Lewy bodies and may have an early pathogenic role in PD (Zhu et al. 2002).
\nTwo additional ubiquitous signaling proteins were found to have decreased phosphorylation states in the brains of PINK1(−/−) mice: CaM and 14-3-3 protein epsilon. CaM has been identified as a regulator of more than 100 proteins involved in numerous pathways regulating apoptosis, neuronal plasticity, cytoskeletal organization, neurotransmitter release, cellular growth, and proliferation and is a vital regulator of calcium homeostasis (DeLorenzo 1980; Benaim and Villalobo 2002; Xia and Storm 2005). 14-3-3 proteins are known to interact with more than 200 ligands including: kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors and have been implicated in numerous neurological disorders (Fu et al. 2000; Foote and Zhou 2012). Aberrant phosphorylation of either of these identified proteins has the potential to cause a myriad of deleterious downstream effects.
\nPHB, another ubiquitously expressed pleiotropic modulator of signaling pathways, was found to have significant down-regulated expression in the brains of PINK1 KO mice. One of PHB's more interesting functions is as a chaperone in the assembly of the electron transport chain, and reduced production of ATP has been noted with the loss of PINK1 (Theiss and Sitaraman 2011). In addition, PHB also has been reported to play a defensive role against oxidative stress, and decreased expression of PHB has been correlated with the aging process (Robinson et al. 2011), both risk factors or mediators of PD. Further supporting the results of this study, PHB has been shown to be significantly decreased in brains of subjects with PD (Ferrer et al. 2007; T. B. Zhou and Qin 2013).
\nDecreases in expression were also found in APT1 and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIaseA). APT1 catalyzes the removal of palmitate at CYS residues from the cytosolic surface of membrane proteins (Dekker et al. 2010). APT1 regulates protein–protein interactions, cell signaling, membrane localization, subcellular trafficking, vesicle transport, and lysosomal degradation (Tian et al. 2012; Kong et al. 2013). PPIaseA, also known as cyclophilin A, is a multifunctional protein that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization at proline residues, playing a role in cellular signaling, inflammation response, and protein trafficking (K. Lang et al. 1987; Takahashi et al. 1989).
\n
\n##Energy metabolism
\nA significant number of proteins identified as having altered expression are involved in energy metabolism pathways. We and other groups have shown that PINK1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial respiration, triggering metabolic adaptations including increased glycolysis (Diedrich et al. 2011; Yao et al. 2012; Akundi et al. 2013; Requejo-Aguilar et al. 2014). The results of previous discoveries combined with the results of this current investigation provide a more detailed molecular mechanism for the increase in glycolysis noted in PINK1-related PD. Specifically, from this study, we observed an up-regulation of several proteins related to glycolysis in PINK1-deficient mice. These include fructose-bisphosphate ALDOA, ENO2, D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH), and transketolase (TK). Not only are ALDOA and ENO2 substrates directly involved in the glycolytic pathway, but ENO2 has been shown to be neuroprotective when up-regulated in microglial cells (Butterfield and Lange 2009; Hafner et al. 2013). Furthermore, 3-PGDH is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the transition of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, the first step in the serine biosynthesis pathway. L-serine is a crucial neurotrophic factor in the CNS as it is a precursor for nucleotides, neurotransmitters, sphingolipids, phosphatidylserine, and L-cysteine (Ren et al. 2013). Moreover, the increased levels of neuronal-specific ENO2 and 3-PGDH are likely a cellular stress response to prevent cell death in the absence of PINK1 (presence of mitochondrial dysfunction), consistent with the finding that blocking glycolysis in PINK1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to rapid death of these cells (Akundi et al. 2013). In addition, TK is an enzyme that catalyzes two key reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in the production of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. Up-regulation of TK provides for more of these essential substrates to be fed into the glycolytic pathway. Moreover, the pentose phosphate pathway provides NADPH, which is needed to reduce oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH). Loss of GSH is arguably the earliest neurochemical alteration in PD brain.
\nDA neurons are reportedly more reliant upon mitochondrial energy metabolism than other types of neurons due, in part, to their reduced mitochondrial reserve (Kingsbury et al. 2001; Van Laar and Berman 2013). In PD, depletion of ATP is major factor in the cascade leading to the neurodegeneration of these DA neurons (Mallajosyula et al. 2009). Significant decreased levels of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (MDHc), and HPRT were observed in the brain homogenates of PINK1 KO mice. MDHc is a metabolic protein of the malate–aspartate shuttle that aids in the transfer of reducing equivalents of NADH into the mitochondria for consumption by complex I of the electron transport chain. A reduction in this key enzyme would result in impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Moreover, reduced MDHc expression is a plausible contributor to the reduction in complex I activity that is reported in PD and PINK1 model organisms (Gautier et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2011b), as cytosolic NADH cannot cross the outer mitochondrial membrane without the enzymatic action of MDHc.
\nHPRT is another metabolic enzyme that is an essential player in the purine salvage pathway for the generation of purine nucleotides (Sculley et al. 1992). Increasing nucleotide metabolism is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis fission events to maintain a pool of healthy mitochondria and has been shown to be neuroprotective in PINK1 models of PD (Tufi et al. 2014). Interestingly, HPRT deficiency is reported to dysregulate neurogenesis (Guibinga et al. 2010), which in adults is responsible for generating new neurons for the olfactory bulb (Altman 1969) and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (Eriksson et al. 1998). Consistent with this observation, PINK1-deficient mice have anosmia (Glasl et al. 2012). And, in PD, impaired olfaction occurs 2–7 years before onset of motor symptoms in over 75% of patients (Lang 2011). Furthermore, HPRT knockout mice were shown to have decreased levels of dopamine that correlated with age (Micheli et al. 2011). Thus, we suggest that decreased expression of HPRT could quite possibly be a candidate as an early PD biomarker.
\n
\n##Proteostasis networks
\nDisruption of two intracellular degradation systems, the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome pathway, has been shown to play central roles in PD pathology (Lim 2007; Pan et al. 2008). Dysregulation of these pathways causes accumulation and aggregation of abnormal proteins and damaged organelles, leading to cellular toxicity, dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Pan et al. 2008). Without functional PINK1, mitophagy fails, resulting in accumulated dysfunctional mitochondria and elevated apoptotic rates (Lenzi et al. 2012). In this study of PINK1 KO mouse brain, two subunits of V-type proton ATPase were found to be altered in either phosphorylation or expression: V-ATPaseA and V-ATPaseF. V-ATPase is a membrane transport protein whose function is to establish a proton gradient, creating an acidic environment in many intracellular compartments, including lysosomes (Beyenbach and Wieczorek 2006). Previously, we have shown that C. elegansexpressing mutant α-synuclein and tau have altered V-ATPase and decreased autophagy (Di Domenico et al. 2012). Furthermore, when the function of V-ATPase is inhibited, autophagy may become dysfunctional because the acidic environment in lysosomes required for enzymatic hydrolysis cannot be generated (Pan et al. 2008). In addition, with diminished lysosomal function, more α-synuclein can accumulate and impair cellular trafficking which may lead to neurodegeneration in PD (Dehay et al. 2013). The catalytic subunit A (V-ATPaseA) was found to have decreased phosphorylation. V-ATPaseA is known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A at Ser-175; and, in liver cells, phosphorylation of subunit A leads to a decreased activity (Alzamora et al. 2010), possibly because of decreased binding affinity of ATP to V-ATPaseA. The F subunit of V-type proton ATPase (V-ATPaseF) was identified as having decreased expression, suggesting an overall decrease in vacuolar acidification and autophagy.
\nAdditional proteins involved in the proteostasis network that were found to have significantly decreased expression were as follows: PSA2, HSP70.2, and VDAC-2. PSA2 proteins compose the end rings of the 20S proteasome, an ATP-dependent multi-protein assembly that is known to degrade oxidized proteins (Davies 2001). Hence, elevated oxidatively modified proteins in PD conceivably could be due in part to diminished function of the 20S proteasome. Moreover, as the 20S proteasome comprises the core of the 26S proteasome, the overall protein degradation abilities of ubiquitin–proteasome system could conceivably be diminished. Consistent with these results, decreased proteasomal function and expression has been noted in PD patients and PD animal models (Bukhatwa et al. 2010; Ebrahimi-Fakhari et al. 2012; Martins-Branco et al. 2012).
\nHSP70 is an ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone that mediates the folding of newly translated proteins, stabilizes proteins against aggregation, aids in clathrin mediated endocytosis, exocytosis (including synaptic vesicles) and is an important mediator for relaying targeted proteins to the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosomal pathways (Meimaridou et al. 2009; Alvarez-Erviti et al. 2010; Redeker et al. 2012). We have previously demonstrated that viral gene transfer of HSP70 protects against toxin-induced DA neuron loss in a sporadic model of PD in mice (Dong et al. 2005). In addition, HSP70 suppressed α-synuclein toxicity in a transgenic Drosophilamodel of familial PD (Auluck et al. 2002). Therefore, the finding of reduced HSP70 expression is intriguing and is consistent with the notion of an increased vulnerability of DA neurons to mitochondrial and proteotoxic stressors in the absence of PINK1.
\nVDAC-2 is a mitochondrial membrane porin that opens at low or zero membrane potential, and allows diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules and ions and thus plays a role in mitochondrial metabolic processes (Blachly-Dyson and Forte 2001; Shoshan-Barmatz and Gincel 2003). VDACs are also involved in mitochondrial autophagy, possibly by recruiting Parkin to docking sites in defective mitochondrial membranes, tagging the organelles for degradation by lysosomes (Sun et al. 2012). A decrease in the expression of this protein in PD would inhibit the removal of malfunctioning mitochondria, contributing to an increase in cellular detritus and subsequent neuronal dysregulation.
\n
\n##Oxidative stress
\nIncreased levels of reactive oxygen species have been noted in PD and PD model organisms (Jenner 2003; Heeman et al. 2011; Di Domenico et al. 2012; Varcin et al. 2012). Not only does aberrant mitochondrial function and dysfunction of proteostasis networks impact oxidative stress but loss of neurotropic factors contributes as well. Consistent with this observation, two additional neuroprotective enzymes were found in this study to have decreased expression in the brain of the PINK1 KO mouse: CBR3 and cytoplasmic isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP+] (IDHc). CBR3 is an oxidoreductase that reduces oxidative stress by catalyzing the reduction of carbonyls to their corresponding alcohols (Miura et al. 2008). This reduction of oxidative stress-mediated carbonyls leads to the creation of a less toxic species (Oppermann 2007). IDH also plays a defensive role combating oxidative damage as it contains a tagging sequence that can direct damaged proteins to peroxisomes for degradation (Xu et al. 2004). In addition, IDHc, utilizing NADP+ as a cofactor, generates NADPH, which noted above is an important cofactor for maintaining reduced GSH, a key antioxidant. Supporting our data, knockdown studies of IDHc in PC12 cell lines demonstrated changes in cellular redox status, increased oxidative damage and apoptotic cell death (Yang and Park 2011). Furthermore, cell lines that expressed lower levels of IDHc were shown to have increased lipid peroxidation, peroxide generation, and oxidative damage to DNA (Lee et al. 2002). Consequently, we opine that these proteins may contribute to the oxidative stress observed in PD brain.
\n
\n##Neuronal plasticity, trafficking and structure
\nMitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in various neuronal degenerative diseases, leading to decreased neuroplasticity and neurite outgrowth (Cheng et al. 2010). Furthermore, PINK1 has previously been reported to be a possible contributor in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, and its deficiency causes dysregulation of this process (Samann et al. 2009). In this study, we uncovered a significant decrease in two proteins involved in neurite outgrowth: EF2 and dihydropyrimidase-related protein 2 (DRP2; CRMP2). EF2 mediates ribosomal translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P site during protein translation, which has been shown to regulate neurite outgrowth in advancing growth cones (Nairn and Palfrey 1987; Iketani et al. 2013). When EF2 is down-regulated or inhibited by EF2 kinase, protein synthesis driving the growth cone is blocked; therefore, formation of new neuronal connections are inhibited (Sutton et al. 2007). Furthermore, down-regulation of global protein synthesis has been linked to impaired chaperone and proteasome activity as cells lower protein synthesis when protein folding and/or degradation pathways are impaired to reduce the burden of aggregated and misfolded proteins (van Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto 2014), consistent with the observed decreases in HSP70 and proteasomal subunit expression in this study. Moreover, reducing protein synthesis has shown to be beneficial in a Drosophila PINK1 model (Liu and Lu 2010). Thus, while reduced expression of EF2 may affect neurite formation it may also be an adaptive, overall neuroprotective response.
\nDRP2, also called CRMP2, is a signaling protein that interacts with binding partners and carries out multiple functions, some of which include: neurite outgrowth and retraction, growth cone guidance, kinesin-dependent axonal transport, neurotransmitter release, endocytosis, vesicular cycling, synaptic assembly, Ca2+ homeostasis, organization of the dendritic field, and neuronal differentiation (Hensley et al. 2011; Khanna et al. 2012; Tan et al. 2013). Even though overall DRP2 expression decreases with age, higher levels remain in areas of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity (Charrier et al. 2003). Previously, DRP2 has been reported to be functionally altered in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, prion disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and PD (De Winter et al. 2006; Sultana et al. 2006; Shinkai-Ouchi et al. 2010; Hensley et al. 2011; Dixit et al. 2013). It is conceivable that reduced levels of this important neuronal protein affects cytoskeletal organization leading to the decrease in dendritic field and dendritic spine number as reported in PD (Patt et al. 1991). Consequently, PINK1(−/−) mice deficient in DRP2 would have severely diminished capacity in neuronal repair, migration, neurite elongation, and maintaining neuronal plasticity.
\nIn PD, multiple neuronal networks experience altered neurotransmission, a condition that is exacerbated by α-synuclein over-expression (Barone 2010; Nemani et al. 2010). In the PINK1(−/−)model in particular, there is a significant reduction in the neurotransmitter dopamine. Decreased expression of V-ATPase in the PINK1 KO mouse is a probable contributor in the breakdown in neurotransmission. Working in conjunction with the H+/neurotransmitter antiporter, V-ATPase assists in the concentration of neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (Beyenbach and Wieczorek 2006). Disruption of this process leads to decreased levels of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Furthermore, synaptic vesicle trafficking at the pre-synaptic cleft is maintained by a cycle of protein complex assembly and disassembly of the SNARE complexes; failure of this cycle can lead to loss of neuronal structure and function(Esposito et al. 2012). A central protein involved in this process, vesicle-fusing ATPase, also known as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), was found in this study to be significantly decreased in the PINK1(−/−) brain. NSF is a membrane trafficking chaperone required for intracellular membrane fusion and vesicle-mediated transport (Whiteheart et al. 1994; Bomberger et al. 2005). Specifically for neurotransmission, NSF facilitates membrane fusion of SNARE complexes (in conjunction with SNAP) for synaptic exocytosis, subsequent disassembly of the complex and mobilization of the reserve neurotransmitter pool (Lin and Scheller 2000; Neuwald 1999; Whiteheart et al. 2001), while also promoting re-sensitization of surface receptors on the plasma membrane (Bomberger et al. 2005). Knockout of NSF leads to an accumulation of synaptic vesicles at the axon terminals and at the docking site (Whiteheart et al. 2001). Consistent with our results and the above notion, PINK1-deficient Drosophila neurons show that rapid stimulation of synaptic vesicles is defective (Morais et al. 2009).
\nLoss of neuronal scaffolding is accompanied by decreased expression of structural proteins. In this study, we found two structural proteins to be significantly decreased in the PINK1 KO brain: NFL and ARPC2. NFL is a component in Lewy bodies and a major structural element in neurons, forming the backbone for other neurofilaments (Fuchs and Cleveland 1998). In the substantia nigra of PD subjects, reduced levels of NFL and NFL mRNA were found and correlated with the severity of the disease (Hill et al. 1993; Liu et al. 2011a). ARPC2 is part of a structural protein complex that plays a role regulating the polymerization and branching of actin filament networks (Gournier et al. 2001; Spillane et al. 2012). Furthermore, in this study, the phosphorylation state of NFM also was found to be significantly decreased. NFM is a structural protein that supports axonal caliber, and altered levels of NFM phosphorylation affect the function of larger neurofilaments. In addition, phosphorylation of NFM produces inter-filament cross-bridges that increase axonal structure; therefore, a decrease in NFM phosphorylation would be predicted to lead to a decrease in axonal caliber (Mukai et al. 1996). Thus, defects in neuronal structural proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of recessive familial PD.
\nIn conclusion, ablation of PINK1 in mice results in differential expression and altered phosphorylation states of multiple brain proteins with critical functions involved in early changes in cellular signaling pathways, energy metabolism, proteostasis networks, oxidative stress, neurotransmission, and neuronal structural plasticity (Fig. 5). Our findings provide a starting point for future investigations of the impact that these differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins and their regulated pathways may have on the pathogenesis of PD; particularly the role of potential environmental triggers that interact with mutated PD susceptibility gene. In addition, further studies are required to determine if the proteins identified here may serve as therapeutic targets to interfere with the progression of PD or as part of a panel of potential biomarkers for PD.

With the ablation of PINK1, alterations in the phosphoproteome and protein levels were noted in several key proteins associated with: increased oxidative stress, aberrant cellular signaling, altered neuronal structure, decreased synaptic plasticity, reduced neurotransmission, diminished proteostasis networks, and altered metabolism. We hypothesize that such changes contribute to the known alterations in pathology and clinical presentation in Parkinson's disease (PD). See 'Discussion' section for more details.
